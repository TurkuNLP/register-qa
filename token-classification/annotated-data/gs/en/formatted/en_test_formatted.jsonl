{"id": "http://experiencejournal.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/i/inguinal-hernia", "text": [{"t": "Inguinal Hernia\n"}, {"q": "What is an inguinal hernia?\n"}, {"a": "A hernia is present when an opening is present in the abdominal wall through which a sac protrudes from the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. In pediatric patients it is generally a congenital abnormality and not something which develops after birth.\nIn adults, these may occur from progressive weakness of the abdominal wall, but this is rarely true in infants, children, or teenagers. A hernia will be apparent if there is a soft bulge in either the inguinal area (the crease between the abdomen and the top of the leg) or in the scrotum.\nA hernia that occurs in the groin area is called an inguinal area. Part of the abdominal contents, such as intestines, can be pushed through this opening. Inguinal hernias occur in 2 percent of all children but are more common in boys than girls. They may occur on either side, but they are more frequent on the right side.\n"}, {"q": "What causes an inguinal hernia?\n"}, {"a": "The testicles develop in boys in the back of the abdomen just below the kidney. During development of the fetus, the testicle descends from this location into the scrotum pulling a sac-like extension of the lining of its abdomen with it (inguinal hernia into scrotum). This sac surrounds the testicle into adult life, but the connection to the abdomen generally entirely resolves. If this does not occur a hernia will result with the sac extending from the abdomen through the abdominal wall and into the inguinal canal (inguinal hernia into canal), where it ends in the groin or it can persist going all the way into the scrotum and the sac surrounding the testicle.\nInguinal hernias are apparent only when there are contents from the abdominal cavity within the sac. In infants and children, the sac may not be apparent if contents from the abdominal cavity have not escaped from the abdomen into the sac because the opening in the abdominal wall is too narrow to allow this to occur.\nWith development, the abdominal wall becomes stronger and can push contents through the opening into the sac often dilating this opening.

In pediatric patients it is generally a congenital abnormality and not something which develops after birth.\nIn adults, these may occur from progressive weakness of the abdominal wall, but this is rarely true in infants, children, or teenagers. A hernia will be apparent if there is a soft bulge in either the inguinal area (the crease between the abdomen and the top of the leg) or in the scrotum.\nA hernia that occurs in the groin area is called an inguinal area. Part of the abdominal contents, such as intestines, can be pushed through this opening. Inguinal hernias occur in 2 percent of all children but are more common in boys than girls. They may occur on either side, but they are more frequent on the right side.\nWhat causes an inguinal hernia?\nThe testicles develop in boys in the back of the abdomen just below the kidney. During development of the fetus, the testicle descends from this location into the scrotum pulling a sac-like extension of the lining of its abdomen with it (inguinal hernia into scrotum). This sac surrounds the testicle into adult life, but the connection to the abdomen generally entirely resolves. If this does not occur a hernia will result with the sac extending from the abdomen through the abdominal wall and into the inguinal canal (inguinal hernia into canal), where it ends in the groin or it can persist going all the way into the scrotum and the sac surrounding the testicle.\nInguinal hernias are apparent only when there are contents from the abdominal cavity within the sac.

I would prefer not to start from the demonstration design, because on the other side of the CPRI link my design is working well, and the demonstration design is quite different from mine.\nI have 2 boards linked by CPRI. The clocks synchronize well. The \"\"Status Code and Alarm Register (0x0)\"\" reads alternatively 0x0F and 0x11 on both sides, if I try to read every 10 ms (my reading is not perfectly synchronized). As written above, on the scope it seems that everything is good for 10 ms, then the link is down for 10 ms, alternatively. I can exchange HDLC data, when I am lucky.\n06-18-2020 06:36 AM\nI have output some debug signals.

Channels 0 to 7 are from the CPRI slave, 8 to 15 are from the master.\nand similarly from 8 to 15 for the master. So the local_lof and local_rai appears first on the slave side. Nevertheless it seems that the link works well for 10 ms. And my slave board works well with another master.\n08-06-2020 04:58 AM\nI have just tested further. I can even exchange IQ data, but only for 10 ms working, 10 ms off, and so on.\nCan anyone help?\n08-06-2020 05:26 AM\nWhich version are you using?

The link is down for 10 ms.\n08-06-2020 07:03 AM\nThe IP behavior changes between 2019.1 and 2018.1, due to a known issue :\n08-06-2020 07:18 AM\n08-07-2020 01:53 AM\nThe issue in 2018.1 is due to a shift in the rx strobe, which was driven to nodebfn_tx_strobe.

Some prefer doing cardio exercises several times a week, while some like to lift weights to tone and build their muscles. On the other hand, some prefer exercises that can help them relax and break a sweat at the same time, such as yoga. Another great exercise you can try if you want to strengthen your core and body control is Pilates.\nThis routine, which was introduced by Joseph Pilates, was originally developed to rehabilitate injured soldiers. Back then, it was not really considered a fitness program until several decades later. In fact, statistics reveal an increase of more than 450 percent of Pilates practitioners from 2000 to 2009.\nThis only shows how Pilates has become over the years  from a simple rehabilitation program for wounded soldiers into a favorite among health and wellness.\nIn a Hurry?

At $475,000 for a one tenth fraction (not to mention the yearly dues) , one wonders whether the owners lodges are in fact worth $4.75 million each, particularly when one considers that the lodges though luxurious are constructed from prefab units.

Likewise its worth considering that the nightly rate for the same type of lodges for Calistoga Ranchs resort guests go for as much as $3,200 in the high season.\nFor those considering ownership its best to approach Calistoga Ranch less as a real estate opportunity than as a lifestyle investment, not normally available to the general public.
