The movie is 1942s To Be Or Not To Be, a marvelous Ernst Lubitsch black comedy that provides a sparkling performance from Benny and costar Carole Lombard.\nThe movie was released a month after Lombard was killed in a plane crash, returning from a WWII bond drive in the midwest. Gable never got over her death.\nThe picture also demonstrates our rule: any movie with Sig Ruman in the cast is worth seeing. (A young Robert Stack is also on hand as Lombards love interest.)\nGranted that Benny did not parlay his excellent performance in To Be Or Not To Be into a successful movie career. Most of his films are poor and deserved their failure, opines British critic David Thomson. But To Be Or Not To Be showed how much greater Bennys talent has been than most of his films required.\nOK, on the answers to our Jack Benny Quiz:.\nAnswer: As indicated above the answer is (b).\n2) Question: Benny worked in movies principally for four major Hollywood studios. Which one rated Benny a star? a) MGM; b) Paramount; c) 20th Century Fox; or d) United Artists.\nAnswer: It was (b) Paramount that declared that Benny was a movie star. But his movies made there was not terribly successful.\n costar in the picture played a regular on Bennys tv show; or d) Benny had an uncredited role in producing the picture.\nAnswer: (c) Eddie Anderson (above right) was Ethel Waters costar in Cabin In The Sky. This appealing actor with the gravelly voice later appeared as a supporting player (as Rochester) on Bennys tv shows. He was superb in both capacities.\n4) Question: Which one of the following did NOT costar in a Jack Benny picture? a) Priscilla Lane; b) Alexis Smith; c) Ann Sothern; or d) Ann Sheridan.\nAnswer: d) Ann Sothern..\nAnswer: (d) See below.\n1 Comment\nMissed several, but its fun to try these quizzes without looking anything up.\nI really thought #1 was all of the above, but I realize Benny didnt play Hitler.

Asked QuestionsMBSP\nThe Government has committed $380 million over six rounds to the Mobile Black Spot Program (the Program). In April 2020 the Round 5 results were announced, with a further 182 base stations to be funded in regional and remote Australia.\nRounds 1 and 2\nUnder Rounds 1 and 2 of the Mobile Black Spot Program, 765 mobile base stations are being deployed across the country to improve mobile coverage in regional and remote Australia. The indicative locations of these base stations can be viewed on the National Map.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including lists of the base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the department's website.\nInformation about the expected timing of the rollout of the 765 mobile base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the Optus, Telstra and Vodafone websites:\nThe rollout sequence is being determined by the mobile carriers based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThese rollout schedules will be regularly updated as the rollout progresses. such as trees interrupting the line-of-sight from the mobile base station.\nThe particular handset used can also affect mobile reception. Each of the mobile phone providers are able to provide advice on the best handsets for local conditions. For example, Telstra uses a 'blue tick' label on the phones it recommends for use in poor coverage areas. Optus uses a 'Top Picks for Regional Coverage' device rating program, enabling consumers to choose mobile phones that will work best on the Optus regional network.\nNew products to improve mobile reception are regularly released. For example, Telstra has released a 'Smart Antenna' to improve indoor reception on its network, and Wi-Fi calling is available on mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device allowing some customers to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. Another effective way to improve reception is to use an external antenna or in-car kit, particularly if travelling on regional roads. The most appropriate antenna may depend upon the network, and prices can vary. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and recognised dealers.\nThe mobile network operators and mobile network infrastructure providers were asked to come forward with proposals to build new or upgraded mobile base stations to deliver improved mobile coverage to locations on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nApplications were received from Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. All proposed base stations included in the applications were assessed and ranked according to the assessment criteria outlined in the Round 1 and Round 2 program guidelines.\nThe application process awarded ranking points to base stations based on how they performed against the assessment criteria. The Department recommended base stations for funding based on the assessment against the criteria including value for money. The assessment criteria included consideration of the:\n- expected coverage that each base station would deliver\n- number of premises and the length of major transport routes being covered\n- total cost of the base stations\n- amount of Commonwealth funding being sought\n- amount of funding the mobile network operator\/mobile network infrastructure provider was proposing to co-contribute\n- amount of co-contribution secured from a third party such as a state or local government.\nRound 2 of the program also included a new handheld coverage requirement ten square kilometres for macrocell base stations and five square kilometres for small cells. The Government funded all eligible Round 2 base stations that met this requirement.\nThere were additional base stations that did not meet this coverage requirement but were ranked highly against the assessment criteria. The Round 2 guidelines provided the department with flexibility to consider these base stations if other benefits justified funding.\nThe department recommended a number of base stations with smaller new handheld coverage outcomes because these were ranked highly against the criteria and offered benefits to the community. For example:\n- A base station may provide a small amount of coverage but this may be to a small town and may be low cost.\n- A base station may address a known black spot where it is not possible to achieve a large coverage outcome because of the terrain, such as in a valley or in a geographically hilly area.\nThe Department's assessment against the program criteria indicated that application of the coverage requirement would in some cases exclude highly ranked base stations. For these reasons, and consistent with the guidelines, these base stations were recommended for funding.\nPriority Locations round\nThe Government announced the outcomes of the Priority Location round of the program on 5 April 2018, including a total of $82.8 million in new investment to address the mobile coverage issues at the priority locations.\nAll 125 identified priority locations will now receive improved mobile coverage as a result of direct investment from the Government and the mobile carriers.\nThe rollout timing is available on the mobile carriers' websites.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including the guidelines and the list of sites under the Priority Locations round of the program, is available on the Mobile Black Spot Program page.\nA list of all the priority locations with a description of the solution at each location is available in the 125 eligible priority locations document.\nThe nominated locations were announced by the Government as part of the Federal Election in 2016. The locations nominated have been identified as areas with poor or no mobile coverage, which had not at that time had their coverage issues resolved under the program.\nThe rollout sequence for each round of the Mobile Black Spot Program is determined by the mobile network operators based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThe rollout schedules are regularly updated on the carriers' websites as the rollout progresses.\nRound 4\nOn 18 March 2019, the Minister for Regional Services, Senator the Hon Bridget McKenzie, announced the outcomes of the Round 4 competitive assessment process. Round 4 of the Program will deliver 180 new mobile base stations (49 Optus and 131 Telstra) to address more coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 4 of the Program targets regional and remote black spot locations, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers are invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 4 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 4.\nRound 4 base stations are currently being rolled out across the country, due to be complete by Q2 2020. However, base station constructions can be subject to delays for a variety of reasons outlined below. Refer to the mobile carriers' websites for more details and updates on the rollout.\n73 base stations will specifically target coverage issues at Public Interest Premises, such as tourist sites and emergency services facilities.\nA Public Interest Premises is defined as a premises or location that the Program considers is used on a continuing basis for a public interest purpose, and which may include:\n- an economic centre\n- an emergency services facility\n- a health facility\n- an educational facility\n- an indigenous community organisation\n- a local government facility\n- a not-for-profit organisation.\nRound 5\nIn April 2020, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, The Hon Paul Fletcher MP, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government, The Hon Mark Coulton MP, announced the results of the Round 5 competitive assessment process.\nRound 5 will deliver 182 new mobile base stations (two from Field Solutions Group, 83 from Optus and 97 from Telstra) to continue to address coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 5 of the Program targeted regional and remote areas, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers were invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 5 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 5.\nThe rollout is expected to commence shortly, with the first new base stations being activated by the second half of the year.\nIn April 2020 the Government released a discussion paper seeking feedback from industry and community on options for the design of a Round 5A of the Program.\nFunding for Round 5A will be drawn from the unused portion of the funding allocated to Round 5 to expand and improve mobile coverage for regional and remote Australia.\nFurther information can be found on the Round 5A 'Have your say' page, Consultation on design options for Round 5A of the Mobile Black Spot Program.\nRound 6\nThe Government has committed $80 million in funding to a Round 6 of the Program, which will commence following Round 5A.\nGeneral\nThe National Mobile Black Spot Database closed for nominations on 11 October 2018, although locations not on the database can still be funded. New nominations are not being accepted at this time.\nThe Government has committed $380 million to the Mobile Black Spot Program to invest in telecommunications infrastructure to extend and improve mobile phone coverage and competition across six rounds of the program.\nAdditionally, we are encouraging the mobile network operators to continue their investment in their regional mobile networks.\nBase stations that have been delayed\nBase station deployment is a complex process that typically takes between 12 and 18 months to complete. A number of separate phases are involved including site inspection, detailed design, planning approvals, site acquisition, construction and final activation.\nAs well as the mobile network operator building the base station, a number of external parties are directly and indirectly involved in the deployment process. These other parties include land owners, local communities, local councils, state government departments, power authorities, other mobile network operators, equipment manufacturers and infrastructure providers.\nPlanning approvals and site acquisition in particular are subject to external processes that are typically outside of the direct control of the mobile network operators.\nIn some instances, these external factors may impact the delivery timeframe for a base station. For example, additional fauna or flora surveys may be required before local planning approval is granted, or negotiations with land owners may take longer than anticipated.\nThe mobile network operators are committed to working through issues as they arise. The program remains focused in delivering new coverage as soon as possible.\nInformation about the expected timing for individual base stations can be found on the mobile network operators' and infrastructure providers' websites: Field Solutions Group, Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. The mobile network operators and infrastructure providers regularly update their rollout schedules as the rollout progresses.\nBase stations that are no longer required or cannot be built\nIn a small number of cases a base station is no longer required as the coverage that the base station would have provided is now being delivered by one or more other funded base stations nearby.\nReasons why a base station cannot be built vary, but can include difficulty in obtaining planning approval for a base station at the original scheduled location, difficulty reaching agreement with the land owner\/s to use the site, as well as unforeseen technical issues with integrating the base station into the existing mobile network.\nBefore declaring that a base station cannot be built at its scheduled location, the mobile network operator will explore all options to provide new and improved coverage to the location, including investigating alternative sites.\nIn some cases the carrier has been able to enhance another base station in the area to meet the coverage requirements of the originally planned base station.\nIf the mobile network operator has exhausted all options and a planned base station cannot be built at its original scheduled location, then funding for the original base station can be used to fund an alternative site.\nIn this situation, the mobile network operator is required to propose a new site that will offer new handheld mobile coverage to another nominated mobile black spot location that is included on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nState government approval of the proposed alternative site is required if the original scheduled site is co-funded by the state.\nThe following base stations have been approved as alternative sites and will now be funded under the program:\n- Beachmere North, QLD\n- Boggabri, NSW\n- Boondooma, QLD\n- Bryant Road, (Marchagee East), WA\n- Burringurrah, WA\n- Cape Hillsborough, QLD\n- Carcoar, NSW\n- Charleroi, VIC\n- Denbarker, WA\n- Duke of Orleans (Caravan Park), WA\n- Girard Hilltop, NSW\n- Goldie, VIC\n- Gollan, NSW\n- Graytown, VIC\n- Guluguba, QLD\n- Honeymoon Bay, WA\n- Jiggi, NSW\n- Jurien East, WA\n- Kalannie North, WA\n- Kanmantoo, SA\n- Keswick Island, QLD\n- Kingsford, WA\n- Lake Magenta, WA\n- Lingara, NT\n- Muirs Highway, Dingup, WA\n- Mulan, WA\n- North Dorrigo, NSW\n- Orpheus Island, QLD\n- Parnngurr, WA\n- Rainbow Valley, NT\n- Ravensthorpe North, WA\n- Tabulam, NSW\n- Tintaldra, VIC\n- Traralgon South, VIC\n- William Bay, WA\n- Wilroy, WA\n- Wyndham, NSW.\nThe following base stations are no longer required to be built under the Program as one or more funded base stations nearby are now able to provide coverage to the scheduled black spot area:\n- Bonalbo B, NSW\n- Lower Peacock, NSW\n- Ocean Beach, WA\nThe following base stations cannot be built under the program due to unforeseen technical or site acquisition issues.

can I do with a degree in (socio)linguistics?\nSome of the major professions in which linguistics is currently being utilized include the following:\n- Healthcare Communication: Training in linguistics is coming to be broadly recognized and very highly valued in healthcare contexts including: analysis\/training\/consulting in doctor\/patient communications; health writing; Discourse of medicine, science and health; narratives of illness and identity change; linguistic accommodation between expert and client; language of agency and responsibility.\n- Legal professions: There are many ways that the skills and training of a linguist become relevant in legal contexts, including: teaching legal writing (training international lawyers to become fluent writers in American legal genres), interpreting the complex language of statutes and contracts; analyzing ambiguity and presuppositions (e.g., in testimony or in cross-examination); elucidation of attitudes toward language in legal proceedings; linguistic analysis (of dialect features, writing or speaking style) in criminal investigations, profile suspects in criminal investigations by analyzing dialect\/speaking or writing style.\n- Education: Many graduates of linguistics become educators (at the primary, secondary or higher education levels, and within corporate and professional contexts). Training in linguistics can help teachers more effectively communicate with their students, to understand how language operates within the classroom and in the wider community. A teacher trained as a linguist is skilled at recognizing how language used in the classroom reflects and constructs social identities (such as gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, race, region, and class), or how knowledge of pragmatics (how language functions in context) can help teachers to identify critical elements of language which play a role in communicating meaning. Such knowledge can inform both the process and products of education, including how teachers design lectures and structure classroom interactions.\n- Business: An awareness of language and communication has a broad range of applications in the business world. Generally speaking, one of the most valuable skills that a linguist possesses is that of knowing how to use language accurately and persuasively. Linguists are trained to observe how language is used and interpreted in different contexts, which has been applied very productively in such fields as marketing, branding, and advertising.\n- Government: Many governmental organizations actively recruit linguists, particularly for translation, interpretation, and cultural analyses. Several graduates of Georgetowns linguistics department have found rewarding opportunities within various governmental agencies by articulating the unique value of a linguists perspective.\nWhat professional skills does the study of linguistics cultivate?\nThe scientific study of language cultivates a number of skills and abilities including the following:\n- Heightened cultural awareness\n- Analytic reasoning skills\n- Ability to structure and support a logical argument\n- Ability to formulate and test hypotheses using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies\n- Insightful observation skills (e.g. identifying and unpacking presuppositions)\n- Powerful communication skills (designing a message for reception by specific audiences)\nWhat professional organizations exist for Linguists?\n- Linguist List linguistics\nWhere are graduates of the MLC currently working?\nAlums and current students in the MLC come from backgrounds in technical communication, diversity training, corporate and strategic communication, research, editing, publishing, writing, healthcare communication, translation, interpretation, and international education. The skills and training received as part of their graduate work with the MLC have led to further opportunities as grant writers; as HR, PR, Marketing, Branding, and Naming, and Technical Communication professionals; many work in education, including as Cross Cultural and Diversity Trainers, or for the Government including the Department of Justice, the Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DC Superior Courts, and the Pentagon. Additionally, every year, we do have a number of students who go on to pursue a PhD (in Linguistics, Education, Sociology, etc.) Please refer to our Alumni Pages for further details on featured alumni.\nWhat Career Services does Georgetown University have to offer?\n- The Georgetown University Career Education Center is a resource for Current students and alumni for up to three years after graduation.\n- Explore career options and search for job listings through the Hoya Career Connection.\n- Or find alumni working in your chosen field through the online alumni database.\nWhat other career development resources are available to me as a student in the MLC?\nA very valuable resource for MLCers is our relationship with the SFS graduate career center. Search for internship opportunities, find Georgetown alums who are working in your chosen field, participate in career development workshops, career fairs, and other professional development events on campus.\nHow do I market myself as a (socio)linguist?\nWe host a number of panels, workshops, and events every semester designed to familiarize our students with career options.\nWe invite professionals to speak about their own paths, providing networking opportunities and practice for our students in figuring out where their studies fit in the big picture. Additionally, the MLC Proseminar (offered in the Spring) is designed to help students conduct research into a professional area of interest. Class time is spent collaboratively brainstorming how one can pull together the skills being developed through linguistic coursework together with individual interests to create a total package for marketing yourself as a linguist. Please refer to this presentation given at the American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL) conference about career paths for linguists.\nThe MLCs former director, Dr. Anna Marie Trester, writes about the intersection of linguistics and career at her website, Career Linguist.\nAre there any suggested readings as I prepare to conduct my career search?\nWe have found two books to be particularly useful for professionally-minded linguists, both of which are used in the MLC Professionalization Seminar (taught in the Spring):\n- Basalla, Susan and Maggie Debelius. 2007. So What Are You Going to Do With That? Finding Careers Outside Academia. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.\n- Oaks, Dalin D. 1997. Linguistics at Work: A Reader of Applications. Mason, OH: Cengage.\nAnother very useful guide including career exploration activities for academics:\n- Newhouse, Margaret. 1993. Outside the Ivory Tower: A Guide for Academics Considering Alternative Careers. Office of Career Services: Harvard University.\nFinally, some very useful web-based articles:\n- The Career-Savvy Grad student from Cal Berkeleys Career Center\n- The View from Outside the Ivory Tower by Alexandra Lord (from the American Historical Associations Perspectives magazine)\nWhere can I search for jobs?\nPlease see our Job Search links for more information on finding a job."}

(range 100  with 0.01 resolution up to 6 k).\nThe performance of the test objects can be up to 800 MVA or even more. The magnetic loading of a transformer is performed quickly using a high loading voltage (60V). This is important for time critical measurements (cooling curves). The unloading of the transformers core is very fast, very safe, as the energy is total destroyed in the MR 8050.\nThe temperature of the test object can be preset or measured using a PT100 probe. The resistance is calculated for 20C using the temperature coefficient for copper or aluminium. Heat-loss measurements with preset time intervals are possible. The resistance at t=0 (disconnection of load) is shown as result of the internal regression algorithm.\nTwo windings (mostly HV and LV) can be measured simultaneously in DUAL measuring method. The MR 8050 also features automatic tapchanger control for measuring different taps\nwithout interrupting the measuring current.\n 2 channels for DUAL measurements\n Measuring time very short due very fast uploading\n Discharge time typ. 1\/10 of uploading time\n Heat  loss measurements with regression algorithm\n LCD-Display with 240 x 128 pixels with backlight\n USB standard and RS232C 9600 baud\n PT100 connector for PT100 temperature probe\n Tap changer connector for automatic tap control\n Warning system connector for separate warning light\n Internal test storage for up to 1000 measurements\n Inputs full protected against static and transient voltages\n Wide current ranges from 50mA to 60A\nDIN EN ISO 9001:2008\nQuestions?\nDont hesitate to get in touch!

on ZIP System R-sheathing with Green Builder Carl Seville\n.jpg)\nQ: Lets start with SK Collaborative. Tell us about your firm.\nA: We are a green building consulting and certification company. We certify single and multifamily projects under all green building programs including LEED for Homes and Neighborhood Development, EarthCraft House, National Green Building Standard, ENERGY STAR, and Enterprise Green Communities. We also provide professional training, and curriculum and technical writing for the construction industry. We provide certification services throughout the eastern US in both the affordable and market rate sectors.\nQ: Youre a leading authority on single- and multi-family green building. How do you work with homeowners, architects and manufacturers to create better buildings and products?\nA: Working with our clients from as early in the design process as possible, we recommend products and systems that will help our clients building perform better while maintaining budget pressures. We provide energy modeling services to assist in determining the most appropriate products for each project, weighing building envelope and system efficiencies for highest performance.\nQ: Talk to us about the building science of managing condensation within walls, and why this is important for professionals or homeowners seeking to build an energy efficient home?\nA: The key to managing condensation is a combination of air sealing and vapor retarders where appropriate. Air leakage is the main cause of interstitial condensation  either from the exterior or the interior, depending on the climate. In most US climates, vapor retarders are not recommended in walls since walls tend to dry to both the interior and exterior, depending on the season. In extreme cold climates with limited or no air conditioning, vapor retarders can help avoid condensation in walls. In moderate climates, air sealing, particularly from the exterior using products such as ZIP System sheathing and tape, helps keep airborne vapor out of structures.\nQ: How do prescriptive code changes in the 2015 IECC guidelines address the issue of thermal bridging which impacts energy efficiency?\nA: The 2015 IECC requires continuous insulation for thermal and moisture management in exterior wall cavities using the prescriptive path in climate Zones 6 and above. In Zones 3, 4 and 5, using continuous insulation with R-13 cavity insulation allows for a thinner wall than meeting the requirement of R-20 in a cavity. Using foam insulation helps keep the interior surface of the sheathing warm in cold weather, reducing the possibility of condensation on this surface, between the insulation and the sheathing. Cold sheathing without continuous insulation has a high risk of interstitial condensation of any vapor moving from the interior of a home through the exterior walls. In a typical wood framed wall without exterior continuous insulation, thermal bridging occurs at each stud, plate, and header, reducing the effective overall R value of the wall well below the rated value of the cavity insulation. By adding a layer of continuous insulation, the thermal bridging is eliminated improving the overall efficiency of the wall higher than the rated value of the cavity insulation.\nQ: How long have you used products from Huber Engineered Woods? How about ZIP System R-sheathing and tape, specifically?\nA: I have seen and worked with AdvanTech sheathing for many years. My first experience with ZIP System sheathing and tape was during the renovation of my current house in 2013. I used it on the exterior walls and roof and was very pleased with the weather and air barrier properties. The house I am currently building will use ZIP System R-sheathing with built-in R-3 insulation on the exterior walls, and ZIP System sheathing on the roof and on the top of the second floor ceiling joists; this is a passive house style technique that will allow me to create a complete air seal on the exterior surface of the walls and ceiling, avoiding problems with ceiling penetrations, such as lights.\nQ: What building methods did you use before you made the switch?\nA: The last house I built used OSB on corners where needed for structure and  XPS on all other exterior walls. Prior to this new home, I typically used or suggested my clients use spray foam on rooflines to create a well sealed building envelope. This project will be using ductless HVAC systems, eliminating the need for a conditioned attic. In this project, I will be using fiberglass insulation, limiting the use of spray foam to miscellaneous sealants.\nQ: How has using ZIP System R-sheathing and tape changed your approach to designing and building the outer shell, or building envelope, of homes?\nA: ZIP System R-sheathing allows builders to create a tight building envelope prior to installation of drywall. With the appropriate design, it is possible to test for envelope leakage before any insulation or drywall is installed, identifying leaks before it is too late to seal them properly.\nQ: Why is a product like R-sheathing  that provides structure, thermal resistance, air leakage protection and moisture resistance  a game changer for green home construction?\nA: In any situation where continuous insulation is necessary or desired, the one step method using ZIP System R-sheathing is significantly simpler and less costly than installing multiple layers of OSB and foam to achieve the same results. In addition, eliminating the separate weather barrier further reduces installation cost.\nQ: Why did you choose this product for this particular house? (Or, what type of impact do you expect R-sheathing to have on the performance of this home?)\nA: LEED and ENERGY STAR certification require either advanced framing or continuous insulation. I will be incorporating both, however even the most advanced framing cannot eliminate all thermal bridging, so the use of continuous insulation will make a well-insulated a building envelope as is practical in my relatively mild Zone 3 climate. Traditionally, continuous insulation is installed on top of a homes structural sheathing in separate steps, requiring multiple trips for the crew around the building. One step to install the sheathing, another to install the rigid insulation, and another to install the weather barrier. Using ZIP System R-sheathing allows a crew to install the insulation, structural sheathing and weather barrier in a single step.\nQ: What are the benefits of using R-sheathing in a southern market compared to its insulation benefits in northern climates?\nA: In cold climates, installing continuous insulation such as R-sheathing can significantly reduce thermal bridging at framing members, significantly improving the overall thermal performance of exterior walls, particularly during periods of severe cold. The benefits of R-sheathing are not as significant in warmer climates, nor during moderate weather in cold climates, since the delta T (temperature differential) between the interior and exterior are relatively small. There are moderate benefits year round, and the combination of continuous insulation and comprehensive air sealing will help maintain indoor temperature during severe cold weather. R-sheathing provides a level of passive survivability should a home lose electricity during a severe cold snap.\nQ: Why did you decide to certify the house as LEED Version 4?\nA: The city I live in, Decatur GA, included a requirement for green certification for all new buildings and major renovations in a comprehensive development ordinance adopted recently. Options for homes include LEED, EarthCraft, and NGBS. Having done numerous projects in the second two programs, and several LEED V2009 projects, I decided it would be educational to certify under LEED V4, before we are asked to provide this service for our clients. Having been one of the main contributors to the LEED reference guide, it is interesting to now be using it to certify my own house. There are some significant improvements in the new program  obviously the USGBC learned from their experience with the earlier version.

have rot at he bottom door casing. What is the proper way to investigate the origin of the leak?\nIs the rot that you're referring to on the bottom door casings is that interior or exterior door.\nWhat is meant by proper way to investigate the origin of a leak. what kind of leak are you referring to.\nThese are french doors, one opens inward the other is passive. The one that opens has a storm door and had no rot. All the rot is on the passive side.\nThe rot is on the outside casing and brickmold, Both the brickmolding and casing are destroyed for about 6 to 8 inches from the bottom.\nWhen it storms there is a collection of water under the carpet opposite the rotted areas\nThere are 3 large custom windows directly above the doors that leaked on the inside until they were treated two years ago. Could they still be the problem on the outside?\nI have repaired the door frame but I'm still not sure I have corrected the source of the problem.\nI removed all the rotten wood, replaced it with new wood then covered the repair with new brick molding and casings.\nEach peice of wood that I applied was caulked throughly before adding another so that every joint in the new work is primed, sealed and caulked.\nI noticed that the threshold moved slightly when I caulked it so I'm not sure the caulking on the threshold was affective and could have been the problem.\nWaiting for the next storm to see if the problem is corrected.\nThank for any additional suggestions for where the water might be entering the door frame.\nI've yet to see a sliding or french door installed the right way, or have it properly maintained.\nThere should have been a sill pan under the doors threshold.Jamsill Guard Door & Window Sill Pan Flashing\nWithin 24 hours that door frame and door should have been painted.\nThere should have been a piece of vinyl lumber installed under that threshold to stop it from flaxing on the outside wall tight up againt the bottom side of the threshold.\nAny new doors we have been ordering have soild vinyl jams, and vinyl brick moulding. Yes they will cost more but only having to buy one door for the rest of your life will make up for it.\nMost of the time when a door fails and there's inside subflooring damage it's because the stoop, deck, porch was built so it's even with the door opening.\nA guarrentyed way to have it fail. It should have been at least 4\"\" below the threshold. A standard step is 7\"\" so that would have been the best height.\nThere is no good way to just patch up your old door and not have it show. By now not only is the brick moulding and jams rotted there's damage to the subflooring under the door.\nNo form of caulking or wood filler is going to fix the real cause of the problum and waiting to see if it works is just going to end up costing more money and time.\nJust step on the threshold and twist your foot, look in the corners of the threshold and you will see the threshold flex and the seam in the outside corners will open up.\nI'll try this again. If there's a stoop, deck or steps right up to the bottom of any wooden door jam, there will be rot If someone buys a new door and does not paint it ASAP with two coats of acrilic latex paint it will rot, doors are shipped primed, not painted in most cases.\nIf the door was installed without the propper support under the outside of the threshold on the outside where it over hangs the outside wall the threshold will twist and flex causing the sealer in the outside corners to crack and allow water to hit the end grains of the wooden jams.\""}

of an Appoint or Remove Directors\nWhat is a Directors Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors?\nA Directors Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is used for adding directors to the board or documenting a directors resignation.\nA Directors Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is a resolution passed by the directors of a company to appoint a new director, typically to fill a casual vacancy on the board.\nGenerally, a new director must be appointed by the shareholders of a company. A new director may be appointed by the board of directors using a Directors Resolution to Appoint Director(s) and\/or Acknowledge Resignation of Director(s), subject to re-appointment by shareholders at the next general meeting.\nWho can be a company director?\nAlmost anyone can be a director. There are very few limitations for the appointment, which makes company formation an available option for many people. An individual can be appointed if they are:\n- At least 16 years old\n- Not be disqualified to be a director\n- Not be an undischarged bankrupt\nWho cannot be a company director?\nA person who is not an undischarged bankrupt cannot be a company director unless allowed by the court. After the court discharges the person from bankruptcy that individual may be appointed as a company director.\nWho appoints directors?\nGenerally, the directors are appointed by the shareholders of a company at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) or rarely at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM). The decision for the appointment is made through the vote and passed if a majority of shares are voted in favor.\nAccording to the articles of association, the number of directors may be limited, so a new director may be appointed only if a vacancy arises. And within 14 days after a new director is appointed the company must announce the Companies House.\nWho can remove directors?\nAs the shareholders have the authority to appoint a director they can remove a director the same way. A director can be removed by 50% at a meeting of the shareholders and they need no reason. This right cannot be taken from them by anything contained in the directors service contract or the Articles of Association. But if a removal violates the directors service contract, or in the terms of a shareholders agreement, the director will have the right to fight for it if he chooses to go to court.\nEven though a reason for removal need not be given. The common reasons for removal are:\n- Mental disorder under the Mental Health Act 1983\n- Bankruptcy\n- Elimination under the law\n- Violation of his service contract\n- Self-resignation from office or\n- Absence from a board meeting for six months in a row\nConclusion\nA Directors Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is a resolution passed by the company directors to appoint a new director. Generally, this resolution is passed to fill a vacancy on the board. While appointing and removing directors from a company, there is a legal procedure that must be followed to assure that the appointment or removal is legal.!"}
