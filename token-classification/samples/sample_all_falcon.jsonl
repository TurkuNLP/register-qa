There’s a certain sort of continuity to their mascots too, as officially they all live in a McDonald’s themed alternate reality known as McDonaldland.\nIn McDonaldland, you’ll find the more notable mascots like Ronald McDonald himself, the burger-obsessed Hamburglar, and a host of mascots based on actual McDonald’s products like Mayor McCheese (the mayor of McDonaldland who, as you may guess, has a giant cheeseburger for a head), Officer Big Mac (you guessed it, he’s a giant Big Mac), and The Happy Meal Gang (a friendly gang made up of the core components of the Happy Meal: hamburger, fries, and soft drink). Even the McGriddle breakfast sandwich got a character in 2003, the Griddler.\nDespite the enormous popularity of their milkshakes over the years, however, McDonald’s never got around to creating a McDonaldland character based on them. Don’t worry though, if your life is truly incomplete without a talking milkshake mascot, you can always turn to the adult comedy cartoon Aqua Teen Hunger Force (in no way associated with McDonald’s, we assure you), which features a crass talking milkshake brought to life by a mad scientist’s experiment.\nTriviaEasy\nThe Spicy Heat Of Chili Peppers Is Measured Using The?\nTriviaHard\nIn Ancient Warfare, Both The Greeks And Romans Fought Off War Elephants With?\nTriviaVery Hard\nWhich Of These Performers Has An Album Cover Created With A Game Boy?\nTriviaEasy\nIn The Early 20th Century, Many Aircraft Engines Were Started With A?\nTriviaHard\nA Popular Sci-Fi Show Forced The U.S. National Park Service To Post Warning Signs Where?\nTriviaHard\nIn The 1960s, RCA Invented A Record That Could Play?\nTriviaHard\nIf You’ve Received HTTP Status Code 418, It Means The Server Is?\nTriviaHard\nWhich Video Game Was The First To Feature A Female Protagonist?\nTriviaHard\nParasitoid Wasps Prey Primarily On?"}

{"id": "http://experiencejournal.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/i/inguinal-hernia", "text": "Inguinal Hernia\nWhat is an inguinal hernia?\nA hernia is present when an opening is present in the abdominal wall through which a sac protrudes from the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. In pediatric patients it is generally a congenital abnormality and not something which develops after birth.\nIn adults, these may occur from progressive weakness of the abdominal wall, but this is rarely true in infants, children, or teenagers. A hernia will be apparent if there is a soft bulge in either the inguinal area (the crease between the abdomen and the top of the leg) or in the scrotum.\nA hernia that occurs in the groin area is called an inguinal area. Part of the abdominal contents, such as intestines, can be pushed through this opening. Inguinal hernias occur in 2 percent of all children but are more common in boys than girls. They may occur on either side, but they are more frequent on the right side.\nWhat causes an inguinal hernia?\nThe testicles develop in boys in the back of the abdomen just below the kidney. During development of the fetus, the testicle descends from this location into the scrotum pulling a sac-like extension of the lining of its abdomen with it (inguinal hernia into scrotum). This sac surrounds the testicle into adult life, but the connection to the abdomen generally entirely resolves. If this does not occur a hernia will result with the sac extending from the abdomen through the abdominal wall and into the inguinal canal (inguinal hernia into canal), where it ends in the groin or it can persist going all the way into the scrotum and the sac surrounding the testicle.\nInguinal hernias are apparent only when there are contents from the abdominal cavity within the sac. In infants and children, the sac may not be apparent if contents from the abdominal cavity have not escaped from the abdomen into the sac because the opening in the abdominal wall is too narrow to allow this to occur.\nWith development, the abdominal wall becomes stronger and can push contents through the opening into the sac often dilating this opening. Some factors place children at higher risk for inguinal hernias such as:\n- prematurity\n- undescended testicles\n- a family history of hernias\n- cystic fibrosis\n- developmental hip dysplasia\n- urethral abnormalities\nAlthough girls do not have testicles, they do have an inguinal canal, so they can develop hernias as well. It is often the tube and ovary that fall into the hernia sac.\nOccasionally, in both boys and girls, the loop of intestine that protrudes through a hernia may become stuck and cannot return to the abdominal cavity. If the intestinal loop cannot be gently pushed back into the abdominal cavity, that section of intestine may lose its blood supply. A good blood supply is necessary for the intestine to be healthy and function properly.\nWhat are the symptoms of an inguinal hernia?.\nIf the hernia is not reducible, then the loop of intestine may be too swollen to return through the opening in the abdominal wall and it may require urgent surgery.\nHow we care for inguinal hernias\nThe Boston Children’s Hospital Department of Urology is a world leader in pediatric urology, offering specialized care for a wide range of urologic disorders in children and adolescents. Our team has special expertise in the treatment of inguinal hernias.\nThe Boston Children’s Department of Surgery provides general and specialized surgical services to infants and children suffering from inguinal hernias.

At that time, we mentioned the fact that the course should not be conflated with \"\"credit counseling,\"\" which is also mandatory, but is a different requirement entirely. Our readers need to know about credit counseling as it is under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nAn \"\"automatic stay\"\" in Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nPrevious posts here have discussed some of the basic differences between filing a bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code and filing under Chapter 13. To refresh, Chapter 7 filings are often referred to as \"\"liquidations,\"\" in which the debtor's property that is not exempt under the law is sold to pay off as much of the debt as possible. Chapter 13, on the other hand, is considered a \"\"reorganization\"\" and the debtor must have an income with which to submit a plan to pay back some portion of the debt in a three- or five-year time span..\""}

{"id": "https://mlc.linguistics.georgetown.edu/career-center/career-faqs/", "text": "What can I do with a degree in (socio)linguistics?\nSome of the major professions in which linguistics is currently being utilized include the following:\n- Healthcare Communication: Training in linguistics is coming to be broadly recognized and very highly valued in healthcare contexts including: analysis/training/consulting in doctor/patient communications; health writing; Discourse of medicine, science and health; narratives of illness and identity change; linguistic accommodation between expert and client; language of agency and responsibility.\n- Legal professions: There are many ways that the skills and training of a linguist become relevant in legal contexts, including: teaching legal writing (training international lawyers to become ‘fluent’ writers in American legal genres), interpreting the complex language of statutes and contracts; analyzing ambiguity and presuppositions (e.g., in testimony or in cross-examination); elucidation of attitudes toward language in legal proceedings; linguistic analysis (of dialect features, writing or speaking style) in criminal investigations, ‘profile’ suspects in criminal investigations by analyzing dialect/speaking or writing style.\n- Education: Many graduates of linguistics become educators (at the primary, secondary or higher education levels, and within corporate and professional contexts). Training in linguistics can help teachers more effectively communicate with their students, to understand how language operates within the classroom and in the wider community. A teacher trained as a linguist is skilled at recognizing how language used in the classroom reflects and constructs social identities (such as gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, race, region, and class), or how knowledge of pragmatics (how language functions in context) can help teachers to identify critical elements of language which play a role in communicating meaning. Such knowledge can inform both the process and products of education, including how teachers design lectures and structure classroom interactions.\n- Business: An awareness of language and communication has a broad range of applications in the business world. Generally speaking, one of the most valuable skills that a linguist possesses is that of knowing how to use language accurately and persuasively. Linguists are trained to observe how language is used and interpreted in different contexts, which has been applied very productively in such fields as marketing, branding, and advertising.\n- Government: Many governmental organizations actively recruit linguists, particularly for translation, interpretation, and cultural analyses. Several graduates of Georgetown’s linguistics department have found rewarding opportunities within various governmental agencies by articulating the unique value of a linguist’s perspective.\nWhat professional skills does the study of linguistics cultivate?\nThe scientific study of language cultivates a number of skills and abilities including the following:\n- Heightened cultural awareness\n- Analytic reasoning skills\n- Ability to structure and support a logical argument\n- Ability to formulate and test hypotheses using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies\n- Insightful observation skills (e.g. identifying and unpacking presuppositions)\n- Powerful communication skills (designing a message for reception by specific audiences)\nWhat professional organizations exist for Linguists?\n- Linguist List linguistics\nWhere are graduates of the MLC currently working?\nAlums and current students in the MLC come from backgrounds in technical communication, diversity training, corporate and strategic communication, research, editing, publishing, writing, healthcare communication, translation, interpretation, and international education. The skills and training received as part of their graduate work with the MLC have led to further opportunities as grant writers; as HR, PR, Marketing, Branding, and Naming, and Technical Communication professionals; many work in education, including as Cross Cultural and Diversity Trainers, or for the Government including the Department of Justice, the Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DC Superior Courts, and the Pentagon. Additionally, every year, we do have a number of students who go on to pursue a PhD (in Linguistics, Education, Sociology, etc.) Please refer to our Alumni Pages for further details on featured alumni.\nWhat Career Services does Georgetown University have to offer?\n- The Georgetown University Career Education Center is a resource for Current students and alumni for up to three years after graduation.\n- Explore career options and search for job listings through the Hoya Career Connection.\n- Or find alumni working in your chosen field through the online alumni database.\nWhat other career development resources are available to me as a student in the MLC?\nA very valuable resource for MLCers is our relationship with the SFS’ graduate career center. Search for internship opportunities, find Georgetown alums who are working in your chosen field, participate in career development workshops, career fairs, and other professional development events on campus.\nHow do I market myself as a (socio)linguist?\nWe host a number of panels, workshops, and events every semester designed to familiarize our students with career options.\nWe invite professionals to speak about their own paths, providing networking opportunities and practice for our students in figuring out where their studies fit in the big picture. Additionally, the MLC Proseminar (offered in the Spring) is designed to help students conduct research into a professional area of interest. Class time is spent collaboratively brainstorming how one can pull together the skills being developed through linguistic coursework together with individual interests to create a total package for marketing yourself as a linguist. Please refer to this presentation given at the American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL) conference about career paths for linguists.\nThe MLC’s former director, Dr. Anna Marie Trester, writes about the intersection of linguistics and career at her website, Career Linguist.\nAre there any suggested readings as I prepare to conduct my career search?\nWe have found two books to be particularly useful for professionally-minded linguists, both of which are used in the MLC Professionalization Seminar (taught in the Spring):\n- Basalla, Susan and Maggie Debelius. 2007. “So What Are You Going to Do With That? Finding Careers Outside Academia.” Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.\n- Oaks, Dalin D. 1997. “Linguistics at Work: A Reader of Applications.” Mason, OH: Cengage.\nAnother very useful guide including career exploration activities for academics:\n- Newhouse, Margaret. 1993. “Outside the Ivory Tower: A Guide for Academics Considering Alternative Careers.” Office of Career Services: Harvard University.\nFinally, some very useful web-based articles:\n- “The Career-Savvy Grad student” from Cal Berkeley’s Career Center\n- “The View from Outside the Ivory Tower” by Alexandra Lord (from the American Historical Association’s Perspectives magazine)\nWhere can I search for jobs?\nPlease see our Job Search links for more information on finding a job."}

No I have ported the code to an Ultrascale+. I have a few errors on the HDLC link, so I have looked at the hdlc_tx_enable and hdlc_rx_data_valid signals on the scope. During 10 milliseconds they behave as expected (depending on the HDLC rate), then during 10 milliseconds they are constant zero, then again they behave as expected, ...\nThank you for your help\nxczu29dr-ffvf1760-2-e\n05-19-2020 11:11 PM\nHi tcachat@metraware.com,\nPlease try to run CPRI hardware demo design.\n05-27-2020 04:00 AM\nFYI tcachat@metraware.com\nIn CPRI Lounge : KCU105, VCU108 and ZCU102 boards are supported by CPRI demonstration designs. In older releases the KC705, ZC706, VC709, AC701, KCU105, VCU108 and ZCU102 boards are supported.\n06-18-2020 05:55 AM\nSorry for my late answer. I would prefer not to start from the demonstration design, because on the other side of the CPRI link my design is working well, and the demonstration design is quite different from mine.\nI have 2 boards linked by CPRI. The clocks synchronize well. The \"\"Status Code and Alarm Register (0x0)\"\" reads alternatively 0x0F and 0x11 on both sides, if I try to read every 10 ms (my reading is not perfectly synchronized). As written above, on the scope it seems that everything is good for 10 ms, then the link is down for 10 ms, alternatively. I can exchange HDLC data, when I am lucky.\n06-18-2020 06:36 AM\nI have output some debug signals. On the attached scope image,\nSo arround the end of a 10 ms chunk, I see local_lof, local_rai and stat_alarm high.\n06-18-2020 07:53 AM - edited 06-18-2020 07:56 AM\nI have changed my debug signals. Channels 0 to 7 are from the CPRI slave, 8 to 15 are from the master.\nand similarly from 8 to 15 for the master. So the local_lof and local_rai appears first on the slave side. Nevertheless it seems that the link works well for 10 ms. And my slave board works well with another master.\n08-06-2020 04:58 AM\nI have just tested further. I can even exchange IQ data, but only for 10 ms working, 10 ms off, and so on.\nCan anyone help?\n08-06-2020 05:26 AM\nWhich version are you using? If you try latest version CPRI, do you see this issue?\n08-06-2020 06:49 AM\nI use CPRI (8.10) and Vivado 2019.1.\n(note that with Vivado 2018.1 and CPRI 8.9 I have a design working well on the ZC706.)\nI observe also that the master changes the nodebfn_tx_nr, then 66.666 µs later (one hyperframe) the slave signals \"\"local_lof\"\", \"\" local_rai\"\" and so on. The link is down for 10 ms.\n08-06-2020 07:03 AM\nThe IP behavior changes between 2019.1 and 2018.1, due to a known issue :\n08-06-2020 07:18 AM\n08-07-2020 01:53 AM\nThe issue in 2018.1 is due to a shift in the rx strobe, which was driven to nodebfn_tx_strobe. It brings resync every 10ms.\nHow do you generate nodebfn_tx_strobe in your design? can you capture nodebfn_tx_nr, nodebfn_tx_stobe and iq_tx_enable signals?\n08-07-2020 02:36 AM\n08-07-2020 02:58 AM\nAs for the fact there is a known issue related to nodebfn_rx_strobe for slave core, can you upgrade your slave side to 2018.3 and later version? And then see if the issue is fixed or not.\n08-07-2020 06:58 AM\n08-18-2020 08:18 AM\nCan you capture iq_tx_enable, nodebfn_tx_*, nodebfn_rx_*, stat_code, basic_frame_first_word in the same ILA please?\n08-26-2020 06:40 AM - edited 08-26-2020 08:00 AM\n08-26-2020 07:59 AM\nOn the Master side, the nodebfn_tx seems correct\n08-28-2020 07:43 AM\nFollowing the above ILA pictures, I concentrated on the nodebfn_tx_*. Until now my iq_tx_gen.vhd was essentially the one of the IP Example Design, except for the IQ data, and it worked well with the ZC706. Yet on the master side I have tried to reset the bfn counter when the link is lost, and I get a different result (still unsatisfactory). In the below scope image, I have changed the signals on the master side:\nSignals on the slave side (0-7) are the same as above.\nI do not have periodically 10 ms up 10 ms down any more. One can observe that the slave loses the link (either for a short or a long time) just after the nodebfn_tx_nr_m changes. The master also loses the link for a short time. The picture can be different, with the master losing the link for a long time about 4 ms after the trig.\nThe link can stay down for more than 400 ms.\n09-01-2020 01:16 AM\nThe image doesn't look clear, when ILA is open, can you go to menu bar, click File -> Export ILA data, and then upload ila file.\n09-01-2020 01:26 AM\nFrom your last reply, 11 doesn't look correct to me, if it's nodebfn_tx_nr, it should be a number, not single bit logic, and it should last for 10ms. From the image, the falling edge comes earlier than 10ms, which causes stat_code loses sync.\n09-01-2020 04:31 AM\nPlease find attached the exported ILA records, with two examples for the slave side, and two for the master side. I came back the the 2020-08-26 version of the code (same as the ILA screenshot above).\nOn the (physical) scope, I am limited to 16 logic signals, so I chose only the LSB of nodebfn_tx_nr_m, which changes every 10 ms.\nPS: <<The attachment's cpri_slave.ila content type (application/octet-stream) does not match its file extension and has been removed.>> I hope a ZIP file is allowed...\n09-04-2020 07:54 AM - edited 09-04-2020 08:04 AM\nI notice there is problem with tx_nodebfn_strobe/nodebfn_rx_strobe_s in slave ILA. What's your ILA clock freq? I need to check if there is an issue with basic_frame_first_word, or the issue is to do generated iq_tx_enable.\nThe tx_strobe timing looks good in master ILA, but the nodebfn_rx_nr looks strange. I think we need to fix the timing in slave tx_nodebfn_strobe firstly.\nIf you want to use nodebfn_rx_strobe_s to drive nodebfn_tx_strobe_s, and iq_rx driven to iq_tx.\nPlease note there is one cycle difference between basic_frame_first_word/iq_rx and iq_tx_enable/iq_rx.\nCan you try to use independent tx_nodebfn_strobe on slave, and see if you can get expected iq_tx_enable? Please try this test on v2019.1.\n09-04-2020 09:35 AM\nDear @xud,\nmy ILA clock frequency is 153.6 MHz, it is the CPRI clock, the \"\"clk_out\"\" from the slave IP.\nIn the slave I used a simple\nnodebfn_tx_strobe_s <= nodebfn_rx_strobe_s;\nnodebfn_tx_nr_s <= nodebfn_rx_nr_s;\nNow I have tried to generate the nodebfn_tx_* independently. I still have the 10 ms toggle. Attached are tree ILA data on the slave side. The duration of the strobe seems better. Trying a few times, nodebfn_rx_nr_s goes to zero shortly after nodebfn_rx_strobe_s is active, and then the link is lost.\nI am using v2019.1\nThanks\n09-22-2020 02:48 AM\nYou are right, the problem is here. To be more precise, the previous iq_tx_enable are regularly spaced by 40 cycles, but the nodebfn_tx_strobe_m goes high to early, which probably breaks everything. My generation of nodebfn_tx_strobe_m was wrong (was done in advance). Strangely the same code worked well on the ZC706.\""}

Some prefer doing cardio exercises several times a week, while some like to lift weights to tone and build their muscles.

Another great exercise you can try if you want to strengthen your core and body control is Pilates.\nThis routine, which was introduced by Joseph Pilates, was originally developed to rehabilitate injured soldiers. Back then, it was not really considered a fitness program until several decades later.

Rather, going slow is actually critical in maintaining your momentum so you will not feel tired easily. Also, make sure to practice proper breathing while doing the exercise. It is okay to do small movements rather than stretching all out – you are basically trying to warm up first before engaging in more challenging movements.\nFirst of all, this equipment was originally developed so that recovering patients can still exercise while bedridden. That said, it is used to keep fit and maintain body strength. Pilates practitioners say when they do the routine, they feel like “flying” due to the gliding motions.\nIt is important to know the basic parts of the reformer and how to use it correctly. For example, the reformer springs have different colors representing each of their resistance levels and stability. There is also a set of straps that can be used in various ways and has different lengths. The shorter straps aim to create tension and usually target the abs. On the other hand, the longer strap focuses more on stability and balance.\nOther Factors to Consider\nAside from the abovementioned characteristics of a good Pilates bar kit, there are other factors that can affect your purchase decision. Among these factors may include the following:\nIn the first place, this is the reason why you intend to buy the best Pilates bars around. Instead of buying a bulky Pilates reformer bed, an easy-to-carry Pilates bar should also do the job. It also has resistance straps that can work your stability, balance, flexibility, and strength.\nAn ideal Pilates bar kit should also have enough support for its users. For example, the bars should have a soft handle for easier and convenient grip. The resistance bands should also have a stable and durable hook or something where they can be attached to the bars. This is to prevent the straps from snapping off while in the middle of a Pilates session.\nAn ideal Pilates bar kit should also be used in other exercise routines. For example, it may be used as an alternative to weight lifting or to simply provide a total body workout. This makes it worth the money especially for those who want variety in their daily exercise routines.\nIt is also important that the Pilates bar kit is easily adjustable depending on personal preference. As mentioned, an ideal Pilates bar should also be versatile enough to be used in other exercise routines like body toning and the like.\nPilates is not just a simple exercise routine for weight loss. It also focuses on core strengthening and improves your muscle tone. If you want to focus on these areas without fear of bulking up unlike weight lifting, Pilates can be a great choice for you. Likewise, Pilates can also improve your flexibility and improving your spine alignment, similar to what yoga usually aims.\nPilates is generally an effective and safe exercise routine for all types of people. It focuses on the abs, lower back, hips, and thighs, although it can work out your entire body as well. While it has been more popular now in the fitness world, Pilates is still being practiced for rehabilitative purposes, in which it was originally intended for.\nFor example, Pilates is being practiced by professional athletes to improve their agility. On the other hand, it is also widely practiced among seniors to improve their posture and balance.\nAside from a yoga mat, other exercise equipment can be used in Pilates including bars or reformers. Such equipment will help users to stretch out their bodies, improve their flexibility and promote spine alignment. Aside from stretching exercises, you will also have to focus on proper breathing and controlling the movements that can release tension and make you feel better inside and out.\nAs mentioned, you can do Pilates using a mat or a reformer. A Pilates mat is basically thicker than a yoga mat aimed to cushion your pressure points. On the other hand, a reformer is a Pilates kit that includes a foot bar and pulleys aimed to provide resistance during your exercise routine.\nIf you choose to use a bar kit on your routine, you can consider the following factors so you can make the most out of your money.\nOf course, it is important to get a Pilates bar kit that you can use for years. Some may have warranties with them, others come at reasonable prices, while some come with various freebies. While some come cheaper than others, make sure that it is made with high-quality materials which can surely last for several uses. More than cheap price and countless features, the most important thing is that it should deliver results as you expect on a Pilates bar kit.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, it is possible to lose weight when you do Pilates reformer. However, it may require exerting more physical effort to take effect. Specifically, it would require around 3,500 calories to lose one pound. That said, you should take Pilates reformer seriously and devote several days a week in this exercise so you can get the weight loss results you want.\nFor one, the Pilates reformer offers several health benefits such as body flexibility and coordination, as well as improves balance and overall body strength. In the long run, it can also improve your posture and movement, and even reduce the feeling of body pains.\nAs per the rule of thumb, any type of exercise should require at least three times a week to achieve optimum results. The more frequent you do Pilates – or any exercise regimen for that matter – you can improve your strength, endurance, and flexibility. Plus, you can lose a couple of pounds in a few weeks if you couple it with a proper diet.\nAs mentioned, Pilates is really effective for toning your muscles, strengthening your core, and improving your body flexibility. However, it is important to note that Pilates is not cardio or aerobic exercise. That is why make sure to do separate cardio or aerobic exercise aside from Pilates to achieve maximum body and health results. However, Pilates can be a physically-demanding routine as well, so make sure to start slow and then gradually increase in intensity over the next few weeks.\nSince Pilates aims to improve overall body strength, it can be effective in improving conditions such as sciatica. In fact, there are Pilates moves that aim to help people with sciatic by building up deep muscles and offer support to the sciatic nerve, hence making the person feel better at least.\nFor one, such equipment like Pilates bar kits aims to improve your strength, flexibility, and balance. Unlike using no equipment, these types of exercise equipment will push you to the limit, to say the least. It will require extra effort to work with these types of equipment and achieve the results you want.\nIn doing Pilates, you are not required to wear shoes as you will mostly be required to go barefoot or wear socks the whole time. As for apparel, go for a tank top or a comfortable t-shirt paired with either cycling shorts, yoga pants, or any stretchable pants that allow free-flowing movement. Most of all, just enjoy the routine!\nSources\n- A Complete Guide to Conquering Pilates Machines, Jan 28, 2015,\n- How to Use a Pilates Reformer for Beginners, Jan 03, 2018,"}

Guardio Protection for Chrome is promoted as a free “antivirus and cleanup tool” that uses AI and machine learning to scan every site and webpage you visit. In addition, the extension can allegedly scan for malicious extensions, information leaks, suspicious websites visited, notifications, hijackers, and harmful store pages visited.\nThe extension will automatically run in the background and allegedly block you from visiting harmful websites, as well as detect malware and other threats on Chrome.\nDoes Guardio Protection for Chrome work?\nGuardio Protection for Chrome is good at detecting potentially malicious browser extensions and poor at detecting suspicious websites. During a testing period, the extension detected 6/10 malicious browser extensions and 2/10 suspicious websites. In addition, the extension was able to provide very minimal information about potential data breaches associated with linked email addresses.\nGuardio Protection for Chrome is self-promoted as a cyber security solution for in-browser malware detection, adware removal, phishing protection, harmful site blocking, and information leak monitoring but it fails to meet realistic standards nor provide any layer of security. In addition, data breach detection is a promoted service that must be purchased and provides very little if no information about every data breach.\n- The extension does not have to capabilities to detect malware, remove adware, protect against phishing, or block harmful sites.\n- The extension is good at detecting potentially malicious browser extensions.\n- The extension is poor at detecting suspicious websites.\nIn conclusion, the Guardio Protection for Chrome extension does work to an extent but not as advertised.\nIs Guardio Protection for Chrome safe?\nOne of the biggest issues with the Guardio Protection for Chrome extension is how it is advertised by the publisher and affiliates. The extension is often promoted by malicious third-party advertising networks on websites known to host malware including illegal torrenting websites and illegal streaming video websites.\nAnother issue with the Guardio Protection for Chrome extension is what it can do once it is installed. Once the extension is installed it can:\n- Read your browsing history\n- Display notifications\n- Manage your apps, extensions, and themes\nAccording to Guardio’s privacy policy, they can collect your personal information, provide it to third parties, use it for marketing purposes, and more.\nAlthough the Guardio Protection for Chrome extension is available to download in the Chrome Web Store we do not recommend using it and instead use real security software and tools to monitor your device and remove malware.\nIn addition to the above, the Guardio Protection for Chrome extension is a high privacy and security risk because it is often advertised in advertisements by malicious third-party advertising networks that are known to show ads for malware, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), and other serious security threats and it reads and changes private information.

What is the proper way to investigate the origin of the leak?\nIs the rot that you're referring to on the bottom door casings is that interior or exterior door.\nWhat is meant by proper way to investigate the origin of a leak. what kind of leak are you referring to.\nThese are french doors, one opens inward the other is passive. The one that opens has a storm door and had no rot. All the rot is on the passive side.\nThe rot is on the outside casing and brickmold, Both the brickmolding and casing are destroyed for about 6 to 8 inches from the bottom.\nWhen it storms there is a collection of water under the carpet opposite the rotted areas\nThere are 3 large custom windows directly above the doors that leaked on the inside until they were treated two years ago. Could they still be the problem on the outside?\nI have repaired the door frame but I'm still not sure I have corrected the source of the problem.\nI removed all the rotten wood, replaced it with new wood then covered the repair with new brick molding and casings.\nEach peice of wood that I applied was caulked throughly before adding another so that every joint in the new work is primed, sealed and caulked.\nI noticed that the threshold moved slightly when I caulked it so I'm not sure the caulking on the threshold was affective and could have been the problem.\nWaiting for the next storm to see if the problem is corrected.\nThank for any additional suggestions for where the water might be entering the door frame.\nI've yet to see a sliding or french door installed the right way, or have it properly maintained.\nThere should have been a sill pan under the doors threshold.Jamsill Guard Door & Window Sill Pan Flashing\nWithin 24 hours that door frame and door should have been painted.\nThere should have been a piece of vinyl lumber installed under that threshold to stop it from flaxing on the outside wall tight up againt the bottom side of the threshold.\nAny new doors we have been ordering have soild vinyl jams, and vinyl brick moulding. Yes they will cost more but only having to buy one door for the rest of your life will make up for it.\nMost of the time when a door fails and there's inside subflooring damage it's because the stoop, deck, porch was built so it's even with the door opening.\nA guarrentyed way to have it fail. It should have been at least 4\"\" below the threshold. A standard step is 7\"\" so that would have been the best height.\nThere is no good way to just patch up your old door and not have it show. By now not only is the brick moulding and jams rotted there's damage to the subflooring under the door.\nNo form of caulking or wood filler is going to fix the real cause of the problum and waiting to see if it works is just going to end up costing more money and time.\nJust step on the threshold and twist your foot, look in the corners of the threshold and you will see the threshold flex and the seam in the outside corners will open up.\nI'll try this again. If there's a stoop, deck or steps right up to the bottom of any wooden door jam, there will be rot If someone buys a new door and does not paint it ASAP with two coats of acrilic latex paint it will rot, doors are shipped primed, not painted in most cases.\nIf the door was installed without the propper support under the outside of the threshold on the outside where it over hangs the outside wall the threshold will twist and flex causing the sealer in the outside corners to crack and allow water to hit the end grains of the wooden jams.\""}

The job outlook for special training teachers varies amongst totally different states and specialties, but preschool-degree jobs are expected to develop 9 percent by 2024 , or quicker than the nationwide common for all jobs. As soon as certified, a teacher might then start in search of special training jobs in their respective state.\nPrevious to her profession as a instructor Melissa volunteered at Friendship Circle for seven years. I am not a instructor but (school student) however have had discussions with many special education lecturers who view these as their prime struggles and I’ve seen some of these featured in articles and just studying online.\nWhether or not you are an skilled SEN trainer otherwise you’re on the lookout for your first job in a particular school, with the most important network of teachers on this planet you are in the precise place. In line with the published BLS knowledge from 2016, the nationwide average salary for Particular Training Teachers (Preschool) is $56,990, with an estimated 28,one hundred forty being employed nationwide.\nParticular education lecturers, in most situations, don’t get as much appreciation as their common schooling colleagues. Answer: Particular training teachers sometimes work a ten-month school yr, with two months off during the summer season. Some of these lecturers main in elementary education or a content material space, equivalent to math or chemistry, and minor in special schooling.\nSince personal faculties charge tuition for a child to attend, particular education companies are usually not free. Additionally, the job outlook development projection from 2012 to 2020 is expected to increase by 16.2{af689d8d24ec74f2bcd29541a5ffe04ad46466e1e371d57624d527eb0aef66f1}.

The movie is 1942’s To Be Or Not To Be, a marvelous Ernst Lubitsch black comedy that provides a sparkling performance from Benny and costar Carole Lombard.\nThe movie was released a month after Lombard was killed in a plane crash, returning from a WWII bond drive in the midwest. Gable never got over her death.\nThe picture also demonstrates our rule: any movie with Sig Ruman in the cast is worth seeing. (A young Robert Stack is also on hand as Lombard’s love interest.)\nGranted that Benny did not parlay his excellent performance in To Be Or Not To Be into a successful movie career. Most of his films are poor and deserved their failure, opines British critic David Thomson. But ‘To Be Or Not To Be’ showed how much greater Benny’s talent has been than most of his films required.\nOK, on the answers to our Jack Benny Quiz:.\nAnswer: As indicated above the answer is (b).\n2) Question: Benny worked in movies principally for four major Hollywood studios. Which one rated Benny a ‘star?’ a) MGM; b) Paramount; c) 20th Century Fox; or d) United Artists.\nAnswer: It was (b) Paramount that declared that Benny was a movie star.

This appealing actor with the gravelly voice later appeared as a supporting player (as Rochester) on Benny’s tv shows. He was superb in both capacities.\n4) Question: Which one of the following did NOT costar in a Jack Benny picture? a) Priscilla Lane; b) Alexis Smith; c) Ann Sothern; or d) Ann Sheridan.\nAnswer: d) Ann Sothern..\nAnswer: (d) See below.\n1 Comment\nMissed several, but it’s fun to try these quizzes without looking anything up.\nI really thought #1 was “all of the above”, but I realize Benny didn’t play Hitler.

However, to create and maintain such an addressing solution takes a lot of resources and money.\nIt has to be easy to use and work straight out of the box, but an even bigger challenge is to ensure its widespread adoption.\nWe have developed a business model that works for everybody. what3words is not open source and our focus is on having the right commercial solutions for different users: the system is free to use for most people, while companies that use the service to make money pay a fee. This approach ensures both the scalability and sustainability of the what3words solution.\nMore detailed answer:\nwhat3words gives every person and every place an address, and helps people communicate and find any location worldwide. what3words provides an addressing infrastructure that works globally, straight out of the box.\nIt is a solution that can be as fundamental a part of public infrastructure as maps or GPS signals. For some, however, this raises the question whether such an infrastructure solution can be – or should be - underpinned by a commercial business model.\nIt’s a valid question, and to answer it, we need to look at the challenge involved. Any infrastructure-grade addressing solution has to be:\n- widely used\n- truly global\n- always-on\n- sustainable\n- work both online and offline\n- and it needs to work in many different languages\nThis is not a mere technical challenge or intellectual exercise. As our friend Steve Coast, the founder of OpenStreetMap, puts it, the value of an addressing solution is “much less in just making any old algorithm and declaring the problem solved. The actual value here is first, to build a great algorithm for people, not just for PhDs in Mathematics. Second to market it.”\nAny modern addressing infrastructure has to be 100 per cent built around the ease of use of consumers, not the elegance of the technical solution. That’s why we have chosen 3 word addresses, because they are easier to remember than strings of letters and numbers.\nAs Steve points out, building the solution can only be the first step. For an addressing solution to become part of the infrastructure, it has to be adopted on a large scale. “Build it and they will come” simply does not work in the world of Geo-referencing solutions.\nTo create and maintain such a solution, and ensure its widespread adoption - not just by companies and organisations, but also by consumers - takes resources and money. Creating an infrastructure solution is not about taking sides in the often academic debates about open vs closed, commercial vs not-for-profit, free vs fee, or proprietary vs public domain. Declaring a project “open” is not the secret ingredient that guarantees adoption or makes it enterprise-ready.\nAt what3words, we have created a model that is usable, scalable and sustainable. Using the service is free for end-users, just like – for example – GPS signals, Google or Facebook. Businesses that use our service to make money at scale pay a fee. Take logistics companies, who know all too well that the “last mile” to the consumer’s house door is the most costly part of a parcel’s journey: with what3words they can reduce the number of wrong deliveries, because consumers can pinpoint drop-off locations. Or think of tour operators, who now can direct tourists with precision to their travel destinations.\nWe are currently working hard to take what3words global, developing solutions for new languages like Mongolian, Telugu, Arabic and many more. To ensure that each of these infrastructure solutions works just as it should - accommodating language-specific rules, without offensive words or homophones, and underpinned by our unique input error correction - requires a lot of resources. We can deliver, because we have a business model that supports us.\nwhat3words is built for survivability. Our solution can outlast our company – what3words Ltd – because our offline tools work regardless of whether our company exists or our own technical infrastructure is down or not. We have a range of provisions, including escrow, so that organisations who integrate what3words can be confident in the long-term viability of the technology.\nWe developed the what3words solution because we ourselves encountered a very real problem: making sure people can safely find and communicate a location wherever existing addressing systems are not up to the job.\nWe want to help other people and organisations to achieve the same. As a business, we have a clear goal: to make the world a less frustrating, more efficient and safer place. Our business model ensures both the scalability and sustainability of what3words as a global addressing infrastructure.\nArticle is closed for comments."}

{"id": "https://zegal.com/appoint-or-remove-directors/", "text": "Overview of an Appoint or Remove Directors\nWhat is a Directors’ Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors?\nA Directors’ Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is used for adding directors to the board or documenting a director’s resignation.\nA Directors’ Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is a resolution passed by the directors of a company to appoint a new director, typically to fill a casual vacancy on the board.\nGenerally, a new director must be appointed by the shareholders of a company. A new director may be appointed by the board of directors using a Directors’ Resolution to Appoint Director(s) and/or Acknowledge Resignation of Director(s), subject to re-appointment by shareholders at the next general meeting.\nWho can be a company director?\nAlmost anyone can be a director. There are very few limitations for the appointment, which makes company formation an available option for many people. An individual can be appointed if they are:\n- At least 16 years old\n- Not be disqualified to be a director\n- Not be an undischarged bankrupt\nWho cannot be a company director?\nA person who is not an undischarged bankrupt cannot be a company director unless allowed by the court. After the court discharges the person from bankruptcy that individual may be appointed as a company director.\nWho appoints directors?\nGenerally, the directors are appointed by the shareholders of a company at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) or rarely at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM). The decision for the appointment is made through the vote and passed if a majority of shares are voted in favor.\nAccording to the articles of association, the number of directors may be limited, so a new director may be appointed only if a vacancy arises. And within 14 days after a new director is appointed the company must announce the Companies House.\nWho can remove directors?\nAs the shareholders have the authority to appoint a director they can remove a director the same way. A director can be removed by 50% at a meeting of the shareholders and they need no reason. This right cannot be taken from them by anything contained in the director’s service contract or the Articles of Association. But if a removal violates the director’s service contract, or in the terms of a shareholder’s agreement, the director will have the right to fight for it if he chooses to go to court.\nEven though a reason for removal need not be given. The common reasons for removal are:\n- Mental disorder under the Mental Health Act 1983\n- Bankruptcy\n- Elimination under the law\n- Violation of his service contract\n- Self-resignation from office or\n- Absence from a board meeting for six months in a row\nConclusion\nA Directors’ Resolution to Appoint or Remove Directors is a resolution passed by the company directors to appoint a new director. Generally, this resolution is passed to fill a vacancy on the board. While appointing and removing directors from a company, there is a legal procedure that must be followed to assure that the appointment or removal is legal.!"}

A: Our season parallels the school year. It is scheduled in two halves: 8 games in September and October, and 8 in May and June.\nGames are typically on Saturdays, throughout the day. U5 through 8 also play on two Sunday afternoons in the fall, and two in the spring.\nU10 through U14 play mostly on Saturdays with occasional Sunday or weeknight games. The difference is because older age groups play with teams from other regions, not just within Flushing AYSO. U10 through U14 half-seasons sometimes start earlier or end later than those for younger players.\nQ: What equipment does my child need? A: You will need to purchase a uniform from Flushing AYSO (or use a hand-me-down, or find one at a garage sale). Shinguards are required. Your child should have a soccer ball of the correct size.\nChildren playing at the U8 level or higher will need cleats. Cleats are optional for younger players. Unfortunately, baseball cleats won’t work; they have an extra cleat in front that can interfere with kicking.\nBe sure to check out our Soccer Swap box, located near the concession stand. You can leave an outgrown ball, shinguards, cleats, uniform, or other equipment for someone else to use – or see if someone left just what you need.\nQ: What size ball do we need?A:\n* Ages are determined based on age on December 31 before the fall portion of the season.\nA: As of the 2015-2016 season, annual player registration is $70.00. Uniform cost varies over time, based on our cost from the supplier; typically uniforms are in the $60 range. There are two types of uniforms, one for U5-U10, and one for U12-U14.\nU12-U14: White socks with white jersey; black socks with orange jersey.\nQ: How does Flushing AYSO compare to travel soccer? A: Here are some of our thoughts:\nA: For all children in divisions U5, U6, and U-8 all games will be held on the age-appropriate fields at Seymour Elementary in Flushing. U10, U12, and U14 play home games at Seymour but will travel to other regions for some games.\nQ: As a coach, how do I contact the opposing coach to cancel or reschedule games?A: We will provide a listing of all coaches in the AYSO system.\nQ: What is the game cancellation policy?A: We do not cancel games for chilly weather, or rain without lightning. When we do, the most common reasons are weather that is dangerous (usually lightning), or fields that are so wet that play would severely damage them. When cancellations occur, sometimes a whole day’s games will be cancelled. Other times, they will be cancelled on an hour-by-hour basis, in hopes that part of the day can be salvaged.\nIn the rare event of a cancellation, we will announce it on the website and Facebook, and notify coaches, who will contact you. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume you’re playing. But it doesn’t hurt to check the website or Facebook right before your game. Reschedules of cancelled games are not automatic or required. Rescheduling is at both coaches’ discretion.\nQ: I haven’t heard from my coach. What do I do?A: We’re sorry! This can happen for a variety of reasons, not always under the coach’s control. Please contact us to let us know, and we will get you hooked up.\nP.O. Box 127 Flushing, Michigan 48433\""}

Some say have a life of three years and some say five years?\nAlso how Reliable Is Seagate Hard Drives? I hear Seagate hard drives internal or external are not that reliable and only last two or three years. Where western digital is more reliable?\nHow long internal or external hard drives last?\n31 Answers\nWhat you're looking for is a stat called MTBF. That means Mean Time between Failure. It gives you an idea in hours how long your disk drive is liable to last. Then you work out how many hours a day you run your computer and can calculate a life expectancy from there. If you want longer lasting hard drives, consider \"\"Server grade\"\", they may cost a little more but they are designed with the intent of running 24/7 for a few years. To be more specific, your life expectancy depends heavily on how many hours a day you run your machine. So if it said MTBF = 20,000 hours, and you ran your machine 24 hours a day, that under 3 years. But if you run it 3 hours a day, it might last up to 18 years.\nDepending on the HDD will depend on it's warranted life. Normal HDD's are warranted to last for 3 years although they can last much longer. Certain specialised HDD's, like Seagate's Iron Wolf Pro, are warranted for 5 years.\nAll HDD's can last for a very long time. Keep in mind that the 3 year or 5 year warranty is based on 24/7/365 usage so that is why they tend to last for much longer because most users do not utilise the same HDD perpetually.\nIn terms of which is more reliable, it is based on personal experience. I've found Seagate to be more reliable than any other brand including Western Digital. The only time I choose another brand is with SSD's in which case, I choose Samsung.\nSadly, there is no real guarantee which drive will last longer or will be more reliable as it depends on the environment it is used in and the user. Sometimes you may be the unlucky receiver of an 'out of box failure' (OBF) which is a dead device.Source(s): 15 Years specialised experience in the industry\n- 2 months ago\ndepends on their use I think. I have had the same one for about 10 years now and just added a second as the first was finally almost full. Still have about 15 gigs left on it it is a 250.\n'\nI Just added a second Sata Drive of 2 TB as I am checking out XBOX PASS for PC and need the extra storage for a few games I plan on adding. Like Microsoft Flight Sim 2020 to go along with My DCS which I have used for about 6 or 7 years now.\n'\nI have also made a clone backup of my main drive in case of a failure.. IT does not make any more noise than normal at this time BUt I rather have a good cloned backup with everything on it than to have to try to reinstall all my programs etc. from backups or cloud etc. ITS easy to Make a clone and just keep it updated and IF There is a failure all I have to do is SWITCH OUT HD..\n'\nI Also DO NOT TURN my computer on and off.. IT stays on 24/7 unless I have to do a restart for something as I think restarting., on and off adds to wear and tear of it.\n- What do you think of the answers? You can sign in to give your opinion on the answer.\nThe answer depends on the types of hard drive and how long they run during a day. I am excluding Solid State Drives from this as they are not hard drives. Servers use enterprise class drives that last longer (or more hours of use) than other drives. This is a requirement of their function. The specifications for drives will state mean time to failure for the drives and this is a good indication, comparatively, of the length of service one can expect to get from a drive. As far as Companies, both Western Digital and Seagate are name brands these days. My preferences is for Western Digital as I have never had one fail yet. But if I was always to have used Seagate, I might be able to say the same about them. I think Seagate had some firmware issues several years ago which may have tainted their name to some people.\nAs far as internal or external, the drive themselves should last the same length of time if the drives are identical and operating conditions are the same. I guess as a general rule, if you had to say, internal may last longer because their operating environment is often better and they might be subject to fewer knocks and bumps especially if the drive is being use during traveling.\nEDIT: As a side note, because I am reading some of the other comments about SSDs, SSDs do have a fixed lifespan, based on read and write cycles. They will fail, or more accurately, be used up, in a fixed length of time.\nI had a Maxtor IDE hard drive last me 15 years. My first Seagate lasted all but a year before it died. All of my hard drives today are all 7200 RPM Western Digital drives, and man oh man, they are really reliable.\nI don't own any solid state drives, so I don't know their lifespan, but I have heard that things you can do with a standard, mechanical hard drive, if you try to do the same with a solid state drive, it will lower the life span of the solid state drive.\nI have an external WD 7200 hard drive as well, and that has lasted me 5+ years so far. It's just a backup drive for my E:\\ drive, where all of my games are installed to, so it just sits up in my closet in the motherboard box.\nEDIT: Just to add, I stay away from Seagate. I never saw them as being reliable.\nOld fashioned electro mechanical hard drives last 5 to 10 years depending on the amount of use the computer gets.\nNewer Solid State hard drives have no moving parts and should in theory last indefinitely.\nBy the time you've had a computer about 5 years though the manufacturer will begin to drop support for it and repairs will become more difficult. So that tends to be the factor that makes people sell on and upgrade.\nI replace my internal hard drives because they ran out of space. When bought brand new, I've had very few problems with Seagate. Western Digital is also a good brand. The problems I've had with internal hard drives happen when I bought them secondhand so I don't know exactly how abused they were in the past. I assume problems occur due to storage as I've noticed that when bought secondhand, the drives aren't handled carefully at all.\nI've been into external drives for just a couple of years and so far, I have no problems with them yet. I've been buying branded ones only from Seagate and Western Digital.\""}

In April 2020 the Round 5 results were announced, with a further 182 base stations to be funded in regional and remote Australia.\nRounds 1 and 2\nUnder Rounds 1 and 2 of the Mobile Black Spot Program, 765 mobile base stations are being deployed across the country to improve mobile coverage in regional and remote Australia. The indicative locations of these base stations can be viewed on the National Map.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including lists of the base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the department's website.\nInformation about the expected timing of the rollout of the 765 mobile base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the Optus, Telstra and Vodafone websites:\nThe rollout sequence is being determined by the mobile carriers based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThese rollout schedules will be regularly updated as the rollout progresses. such as trees interrupting the line-of-sight from the mobile base station.\nThe particular handset used can also affect mobile reception. Each of the mobile phone providers are able to provide advice on the best handsets for local conditions. For example, Telstra uses a 'blue tick' label on the phones it recommends for use in poor coverage areas. Optus uses a 'Top Picks for Regional Coverage' device rating program, enabling consumers to choose mobile phones that will work best on the Optus regional network.\nNew products to improve mobile reception are regularly released. For example, Telstra has released a 'Smart Antenna' to improve indoor reception on its network, and Wi-Fi calling is available on mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device allowing some customers to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. Another effective way to improve reception is to use an external antenna or in-car kit, particularly if travelling on regional roads. The most appropriate antenna may depend upon the network, and prices can vary. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and recognised dealers.\nThe mobile network operators and mobile network infrastructure providers were asked to come forward with proposals to build new or upgraded mobile base stations to deliver improved mobile coverage to locations on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nApplications were received from Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. All proposed base stations included in the applications were assessed and ranked according to the assessment criteria outlined in the Round 1 and Round 2 program guidelines.\nThe application process awarded ranking points to base stations based on how they performed against the assessment criteria. The Department recommended base stations for funding based on the assessment against the criteria including value for money. The assessment criteria included consideration of the:\n- expected coverage that each base station would deliver\n- number of premises and the length of major transport routes being covered\n- total cost of the base stations\n- amount of Commonwealth funding being sought\n- amount of funding the mobile network operator/mobile network infrastructure provider was proposing to co-contribute\n- amount of co-contribution secured from a third party such as a state or local government.\nRound 2 of the program also included a new handheld coverage requirement— ten square kilometres for macrocell base stations and five square kilometres for small cells. The Government funded all eligible Round 2 base stations that met this requirement.\nThere were additional base stations that did not meet this coverage requirement but were ranked highly against the assessment criteria. The Round 2 guidelines provided the department with flexibility to consider these base stations if other benefits justified funding.\nThe department recommended a number of base stations with smaller new handheld coverage outcomes because these were ranked highly against the criteria and offered benefits to the community. For example:\n- A base station may provide a small amount of coverage but this may be to a small town and may be low cost.\n- A base station may address a known black spot where it is not possible to achieve a large coverage outcome because of the terrain, such as in a valley or in a geographically hilly area.\nThe Department's assessment against the program criteria indicated that application of the coverage requirement would in some cases exclude highly ranked base stations. For these reasons, and consistent with the guidelines, these base stations were recommended for funding.\nPriority Locations round\nThe Government announced the outcomes of the Priority Location round of the program on 5 April 2018, including a total of $82.8 million in new investment to address the mobile coverage issues at the priority locations.\nAll 125 identified priority locations will now receive improved mobile coverage as a result of direct investment from the Government and the mobile carriers.\nThe rollout timing is available on the mobile carriers' websites.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including the guidelines and the list of sites under the Priority Locations round of the program, is available on the Mobile Black Spot Program page.\nA list of all the priority locations with a description of the solution at each location is available in the 125 eligible priority locations document.\nThe nominated locations were announced by the Government as part of the Federal Election in 2016. The locations nominated have been identified as areas with poor or no mobile coverage, which had not at that time had their coverage issues resolved under the program.\nThe rollout sequence for each round of the Mobile Black Spot Program is determined by the mobile network operators based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThe rollout schedules are regularly updated on the carriers' websites as the rollout progresses.\nRound 4\nOn 18 March 2019, the Minister for Regional Services, Senator the Hon Bridget McKenzie, announced the outcomes of the Round 4 competitive assessment process. Round 4 of the Program will deliver 180 new mobile base stations (49 Optus and 131 Telstra) to address more coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 4 of the Program targets regional and remote black spot locations, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers are invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 4 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 4.\nRound 4 base stations are currently being rolled out across the country, due to be complete by Q2 2020. However, base station constructions can be subject to delays for a variety of reasons outlined below. Refer to the mobile carriers' websites for more details and updates on the rollout.\n73 base stations will specifically target coverage issues at Public Interest Premises, such as tourist sites and emergency services facilities.\nA Public Interest Premises is defined as a premises or location that the Program considers is used on a continuing basis for a public interest purpose, and which may include:\n- an economic centre\n- an emergency services facility\n- a health facility\n- an educational facility\n- an indigenous community organisation\n- a local government facility\n- a not-for-profit organisation.\nRound 5\nIn April 2020, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, The Hon Paul Fletcher MP, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government, The Hon Mark Coulton MP, announced the results of the Round 5 competitive assessment process.\nRound 5 will deliver 182 new mobile base stations (two from Field Solutions Group, 83 from Optus and 97 from Telstra) to continue to address coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 5 of the Program targeted regional and remote areas, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers were invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 5 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 5.\nThe rollout is expected to commence shortly, with the first new base stations being activated by the second half of the year.\nIn April 2020 the Government released a discussion paper seeking feedback from industry and community on options for the design of a Round 5A of the Program.\nFunding for Round 5A will be drawn from the unused portion of the funding allocated to Round 5 to expand and improve mobile coverage for regional and remote Australia.\nFurther information can be found on the Round 5A 'Have your say' page, Consultation on design options for Round 5A of the Mobile Black Spot Program.\nRound 6\nThe Government has committed $80 million in funding to a Round 6 of the Program, which will commence following Round 5A.\nGeneral\nThe National Mobile Black Spot Database closed for nominations on 11 October 2018, although locations not on the database can still be funded. New nominations are not being accepted at this time.\nThe Government has committed $380 million to the Mobile Black Spot Program to invest in telecommunications infrastructure to extend and improve mobile phone coverage and competition across six rounds of the program.\nAdditionally, we are encouraging the mobile network operators to continue their investment in their regional mobile networks.\nBase stations that have been delayed\nBase station deployment is a complex process that typically takes between 12 and 18 months to complete. A number of separate phases are involved including site inspection, detailed design, planning approvals, site acquisition, construction and final activation.\nAs well as the mobile network operator building the base station, a number of external parties are directly and indirectly involved in the deployment process. These other parties include land owners, local communities, local councils, state government departments, power authorities, other mobile network operators, equipment manufacturers and infrastructure providers.\nPlanning approvals and site acquisition in particular are subject to external processes that are typically outside of the direct control of the mobile network operators.\nIn some instances, these external factors may impact the delivery timeframe for a base station. For example, additional fauna or flora surveys may be required before local planning approval is granted, or negotiations with land owners may take longer than anticipated.\nThe mobile network operators are committed to working through issues as they arise. The program remains focused in delivering new coverage as soon as possible.\nInformation about the expected timing for individual base stations can be found on the mobile network operators' and infrastructure providers' websites: Field Solutions Group, Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. The mobile network operators and infrastructure providers regularly update their rollout schedules as the rollout progresses.\nBase stations that are no longer required or cannot be built\nIn a small number of cases a base station is no longer required as the coverage that the base station would have provided is now being delivered by one or more other funded base stations nearby.\nReasons why a base station cannot be built vary, but can include difficulty in obtaining planning approval for a base station at the original scheduled location, difficulty reaching agreement with the land owner/s to use the site, as well as unforeseen technical issues with integrating the base station into the existing mobile network.\nBefore declaring that a base station cannot be built at its scheduled location, the mobile network operator will explore all options to provide new and improved coverage to the location, including investigating alternative sites.\nIn some cases the carrier has been able to enhance another base station in the area to meet the coverage requirements of the originally planned base station.\nIf the mobile network operator has exhausted all options and a planned base station cannot be built at its original scheduled location, then funding for the original base station can be used to fund an alternative site.\nIn this situation, the mobile network operator is required to propose a new site that will offer new handheld mobile coverage to another nominated mobile black spot location that is included on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nState government approval of the proposed alternative site is required if the original scheduled site is co-funded by the state.\nThe following base stations have been approved as alternative sites and will now be funded under the program:\n- Beachmere North, QLD\n- Boggabri, NSW\n- Boondooma, QLD\n- Bryant Road, (Marchagee East), WA\n- Burringurrah, WA\n- Cape Hillsborough, QLD\n- Carcoar, NSW\n- Charleroi, VIC\n- Denbarker, WA\n- Duke of Orleans (Caravan Park), WA\n- Girard Hilltop, NSW\n- Goldie, VIC\n- Gollan, NSW\n- Graytown, VIC\n- Guluguba, QLD\n- Honeymoon Bay, WA\n- Jiggi, NSW\n- Jurien East, WA\n- Kalannie North, WA\n- Kanmantoo, SA\n- Keswick Island, QLD\n- Kingsford, WA\n- Lake Magenta, WA\n- Lingara, NT\n- Muirs Highway, Dingup, WA\n- Mulan, WA\n- North Dorrigo, NSW\n- Orpheus Island, QLD\n- Parnngurr, WA\n- Rainbow Valley, NT\n- Ravensthorpe North, WA\n- Tabulam, NSW\n- Tintaldra, VIC\n- Traralgon South, VIC\n- William Bay, WA\n- Wilroy, WA\n- Wyndham, NSW.\nThe following base stations are no longer required to be built under the Program as one or more funded base stations nearby are now able to provide coverage to the scheduled black spot area:\n- Bonalbo B, NSW\n- Lower Peacock, NSW\n- Ocean Beach, WA\nThe following base stations cannot be built under the program due to unforeseen technical or site acquisition issues.

Ownership at the resort cum fractional offering may not be exactly the same as holding a sprawling vineyard, but it does a fine job of serving up a slice of the idle elegance of Napa living.\nThe Lay of the Land\nCalistoga Ranch’s aura of intimacy and relaxation is due in no small to by the resort’s topography: a protected gently sloping canyon whose mouth extends from a northeast corner of the Napa valley. The resort’s 157 acres, populated by oaks and peregrinating families of deer, features several hiking trails which afford sweeping views of the vineyards in the valley below.\nOperated by Auberge Resorts, whose Auberge de Soleil has more or less served as the ne plus ultra of Napa Valley chic for more than a generation, the Calistoga Ranch presents a different, but no less sophisticated aesthetic. Where the Auberge de Soleil channels Provence with its stucco and saffron motif, Calistoga Ranch presents a less embellished, if somewhat prosaic, naturalist design vision. The emphasis here is on complimenting, not upstaging, the land.\nWhat’s For Sale\nThe detached 3,000 square foot shingled owners lodges dotting the hillside afford a surprising amount of privacy, even as they each feature large enclosed outdoor living areas connecting the various modules: kitchen, living room, master and guest bedroom. With their outdoor fire places, grills, and comfortable furniture, these atriums are a inviting and natural space, serving as the lodges’ focal point. Muted tans, creams, and ocher colors go well with the stained wood floors. While the design might be lacking somewhat in terms of personality and spontaneity, the overall effect is tasteful and refined: a more than adequate compensation, and one which is well suited to the reality of shared ownership.\nThe master bedrooms feature well appointed bathrooms with large tubs and showers, his and her faucets, and ample closet space. Owners are likely to take frequent advantage of the outdoor showers just off the master bathroom for a sensuous pleine air pick-me-up. Here again, the evident thought that went into preserving the privacy of each lodge is much appreciated.\nAppliances and amenities throughout lodges are all first rate: flat screen televisions, high-end stereo, Viking range and refrigerators in the well stocked kitchen, soft robes, to go along with fine linens and tastefully chosen furniture.\nWhat You Get\nThe resort’s restaurant, at the top of the trail winding up the canyon serves up delicious Cal-cuisine fare. Enjoying a meal on the terrace there, overlooking a beautiful pond, with a glass of Pinot in hand is an experience that I wouldn’t expect anyone to tire from too quickly.\nThe same could be said for Calistoga Ranch’s tranquil spa, where any number of expertly administered treatments are available. The pool, which overlooks the resort’s own vineyards, is ideal for sun-soaked Napa summer days. While the die hard gym nuts will likely need to go elsewhere for their power lifts, the work out facilities are more than adequate for those of us trying to work off that extra piece of tiramisu.\nWhile the promotional nature of our trip made it difficult to objectively gauge the level of service at Calistoga Ranch, the guests and members I spoke with all confirmed the same alacrity and superior consideration from the concierge and staff.\nThe Halogen Guides Take\nThere’s no denying that this level of luxury doesn’t come cheap, and it is difficult to make the case for ownership strictly as a value proposition. At $475,000 for a one tenth fraction (not to mention the yearly dues) , one wonders whether the owners’ lodges are in fact worth $4.75 million each, particularly when one considers that the lodges though luxurious are constructed from prefab units. At the same time, it’s not likely you could find much more than a shack in the valley anywhere north of the city of Napa for less than $500,000. Likewise it’s worth considering that the nightly rate for the same type of lodges for Calistoga Ranch’s resort guests go for as much as $3,200 in the high season.\nFor those considering ownership it’s best to approach Calistoga Ranch less as a real estate opportunity than as a lifestyle investment, not normally available to the general public. The club’s Vintner Program, for one, allows members exclusive access to a variety of the finest wineries in the valley, from legendary vintners like Robert Mondavi to “cult” wine makers like the Grace Family Vineyards. Privileges include private tours and yearly parties at each of the 39 vintner partners’ plots. Oenophile owners can also store their wine in Calistoga Ranch’s expansive cave, for optimal preservation.\nThere are daily activities always on offer: everything from yoga, tai chi, painting classes, or for the less ambitious, mojito-making seminars. Is it worth the price tag? As with anything else, that all depends on what you value. What we can say is that Calistoga Ranch is a positively charming place, which we would return to again and again. For those looking to buy a piece of the languorous romance that is the Napa valley, and with liberal budgets, we would give Calistoga Ranch our hearty recommendation.\nFrom: MagicOPromotionTuesday, May, 05, 2009 at 08:09 AM\nWell...

Are there others among the 30 who are simply part of a postwar reconstruction effort?\nMr. Boucher: Many of these people are associated somehow militarily with the action. I think most, almost all is probably a better description. Some of them, like Japan, are probably exclusively interested in the post-conflict situation and helping out if we get to that, but I think most of these others, if you look at what they, themselves, have said, are in some ways willing or participating in, or supporting potential conflict, if that's where it ends up.\nQuestion: And two, I know you don't want to get into specifics of what each country would offer, but at least two countries on this list kind of jump out at me in terms of their abilities to do anything, and that would be Afghanistan and Ethiopia.When you need to pad your list with Eritrea then you don't have a coalition.

They may not be providing a specific resource, or they may just be allowing access, overflight, or other participation in that way, or they may just have decided they want to be publicly associated with the effort to disarm Iraq. Remember, that is the fundamental of this, that these are countries who have all stood up and said it is time to disarm Iraq, and if Iraq doesn't do that peacefully, we need to be prepared to do it by whatever means are necessary -- people that are associating themselves in public with the effort to make sure that Iraq is disarmed and disarmed soon.\nQuestion: Did -- I assume that you asked everybody in the world whether they were willing to go on this list, and therefore you had 160 rejections, were there?Boucher says no. He's probably right, the number is probably like 120 rejections, after all we already knew what France, Russia, etc. would say."}

{"id": "https://www.huberwood.com/blog/qa-on-zip-system-r-sheathing-with-green-builder-carl-seville", "text": "Q&A on ZIP System® R-sheathing with Green Builder Carl Seville\n.jpg)\nQ: Let’s start with SK Collaborative. Tell us about your firm.\nA: We are a green building consulting and certification company. We certify single and multifamily projects under all green building programs including LEED for Homes and Neighborhood Development, EarthCraft House, National Green Building Standard, ENERGY STAR, and Enterprise Green Communities. We also provide professional training, and curriculum and technical writing for the construction industry. We provide certification services throughout the eastern US in both the affordable and market rate sectors.\nQ: You’re a leading authority on single- and multi-family green building. How do you work with homeowners, architects and manufacturers to create better buildings and products?\nA: Working with our clients from as early in the design process as possible, we recommend products and systems that will help our clients’ building perform better while maintaining budget pressures. We provide energy modeling services to assist in determining the most appropriate products for each project, weighing building envelope and system efficiencies for highest performance.\nQ: Talk to us about the building science of managing condensation within walls, and why this is important for professionals or homeowners seeking to build an energy efficient home?\nA: The key to managing condensation is a combination of air sealing and vapor retarders where appropriate. Air leakage is the main cause of interstitial condensation – either from the exterior or the interior, depending on the climate. In most US climates, vapor retarders are not recommended in walls since walls tend to dry to both the interior and exterior, depending on the season. In extreme cold climates with limited or no air conditioning, vapor retarders can help avoid condensation in walls. In moderate climates, air sealing, particularly from the exterior using products such as ZIP System® sheathing and tape, helps keep airborne vapor out of structures.\nQ: How do prescriptive code changes in the 2015 IECC guidelines address the issue of thermal bridging which impacts energy efficiency?\nA: The 2015 IECC requires continuous insulation for thermal and moisture management in exterior wall cavities using the prescriptive path in climate Zones 6 and above. In Zones 3, 4 and 5, using continuous insulation with R-13 cavity insulation allows for a thinner wall than meeting the requirement of R-20 in a cavity. Using foam insulation helps keep the interior surface of the sheathing warm in cold weather, reducing the possibility of condensation on this surface, between the insulation and the sheathing. Cold sheathing without continuous insulation has a high risk of interstitial condensation of any vapor moving from the interior of a home through the exterior walls. In a typical wood framed wall without exterior continuous insulation, thermal bridging occurs at each stud, plate, and header, reducing the effective overall R value of the wall well below the rated value of the cavity insulation. By adding a layer of continuous insulation, the thermal bridging is eliminated improving the overall efficiency of the wall higher than the rated value of the cavity insulation.\nQ: How long have you used products from Huber Engineered Woods? How about ZIP System R-sheathing and tape, specifically?\nA: I have seen and worked with AdvanTech® sheathing for many years. My first experience with ZIP System sheathing and tape was during the renovation of my current house in 2013. I used it on the exterior walls and roof and was very pleased with the weather and air barrier properties. The house I am currently building will use ZIP System® R-sheathing with built-in R-3 insulation on the exterior walls, and ZIP System® sheathing on the roof and on the top of the second floor ceiling joists; this is a passive house style technique that will allow me to create a complete air seal on the exterior surface of the walls and ceiling, avoiding problems with ceiling penetrations, such as lights.\nQ: What building methods did you use before you made the switch?\nA: The last house I built used OSB on corners where needed for structure and ½” XPS on all other exterior walls. Prior to this new home, I typically used or suggested my clients use spray foam on rooflines to create a well sealed building envelope. This project will be using ductless HVAC systems, eliminating the need for a conditioned attic. In this project, I will be using fiberglass insulation, limiting the use of spray foam to miscellaneous sealants.\nQ: How has using ZIP System® R-sheathing and tape changed your approach to designing and building the outer shell, or building envelope, of homes?\nA: ZIP System R-sheathing allows builders to create a tight building envelope prior to installation of drywall. With the appropriate design, it is possible to test for envelope leakage before any insulation or drywall is installed, identifying leaks before it is too late to seal them properly.\nQ: Why is a product like R-sheathing – that provides structure, thermal resistance, air leakage protection and moisture resistance – a “game changer” for green home construction?\nA: In any situation where continuous insulation is necessary or desired, the one step method using ZIP System R-sheathing is significantly simpler and less costly than installing multiple layers of OSB and foam to achieve the same results. In addition, eliminating the separate weather barrier further reduces installation cost.\nQ: Why did you choose this product for this particular house? (Or, what type of impact do you expect R-sheathing to have on the performance of this home?)\nA: LEED and ENERGY STAR certification require either advanced framing or continuous insulation. I will be incorporating both, however even the most advanced framing cannot eliminate all thermal bridging, so the use of continuous insulation will make a well-insulated a building envelope as is practical in my relatively mild Zone 3 climate. Traditionally, continuous insulation is installed on top of a home’s structural sheathing in separate steps, requiring multiple trips for the crew around the building. One step to install the sheathing, another to install the rigid insulation, and another to install the weather barrier. Using ZIP System R-sheathing allows a crew to install the insulation, structural sheathing and weather barrier in a single step.\nQ: What are the benefits of using R-sheathing in a southern market compared to its insulation benefits in northern climates?\nA: In cold climates, installing continuous insulation such as R-sheathing can significantly reduce thermal bridging at framing members, significantly improving the overall thermal performance of exterior walls, particularly during periods of severe cold. The benefits of R-sheathing are not as significant in warmer climates, nor during moderate weather in cold climates, since the delta T (temperature differential) between the interior and exterior are relatively small. There are moderate benefits year round, and the combination of continuous insulation and comprehensive air sealing will help maintain indoor temperature during severe cold weather. R-sheathing provides a level of passive survivability should a home lose electricity during a severe cold snap.\nQ: Why did you decide to certify the house as LEED Version 4?\nA: The city I live in, Decatur GA, included a requirement for green certification for all new buildings and major renovations in a comprehensive development ordinance adopted recently. Options for homes include LEED, EarthCraft, and NGBS. Having done numerous projects in the second two programs, and several LEED V2009 projects, I decided it would be educational to certify under LEED V4, before we are asked to provide this service for our clients. Having been one of the main contributors to the LEED reference guide, it is interesting to now be using it to certify my own house. There are some significant improvements in the new program – obviously the USGBC learned from their experience with the earlier version. I will likely also certify under EarthCraft and NGBS as well.\nFor more information on ZIP System R-sheathing, watch the video below or visit ZIPSystem.com/R-sheathing.

To be \"\"isolationist\"\" is to not want to be obliged to participate in wars between other nations, e.g. if France and Germany go to war, you don't want to be forced to participate on either side. Remember, the general perception at the close of the First World War was that the war had started over a silly local thing -- the assassination of the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist, and only became general because of the great web of mutual treaty obligations that sucked the remaining Great Powers into the war, e.g. once Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, the Russians (traditional defenders of Serbia) felt obliged to declare war on Austria-Hungary, and then Germany (obliged to Austria-Hungary by treaty) had to declare war on Russia, and then England and France (obliged to Russia by treaty) had to declare war on Germany, and then Austria-Hungary had to declare war on France and England. That's certainly oversimlified. There are plenty of ways the nations could have turned aside from war had they really wanted to, treaty obligations or not. But it has enough kernel of truth to make some American politicians extremely wary of gettling tangled up in mutual treaty obligations for the defense of one European nation against another. That all changed after the Second World War, because war was no longer restricted to continents. The advent of the aircraft carrier, submarine, long-range bomber and atomic bomb meant that a war in Europe would probably very quickly spread to the United States, even an ocean away. It was no longer really possible to let the Europeans sort themselves.\""}
