At that time, we mentioned the fact that the course should not be conflated with \"\"credit counseling,\"\" which is also mandatory, but is a different requirement entirely. Our readers need to know about credit counseling as it is under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nAn \"\"automatic stay\"\" in Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nPrevious posts here have discussed some of the basic differences between filing a bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code and filing under Chapter 13. To refresh, Chapter 7 filings are often referred to as \"\"liquidations,\"\" in which the debtor's property that is not exempt under the law is sold to pay off as much of the debt as possible. Chapter 13, on the other hand, is considered a \"\"reorganization\"\" and the debtor must have an income with which to submit a plan to pay back some portion of the debt in a three- or five-year time span..\""}

{"id": "https://mlc.linguistics.georgetown.edu/career-center/career-faqs/", "text": "What can I do with a degree in (socio)linguistics?\nSome of the major professions in which linguistics is currently being utilized include the following:\n- Healthcare Communication: Training in linguistics is coming to be broadly recognized and very highly valued in healthcare contexts including: analysis/training/consulting in doctor/patient communications; health writing; Discourse of medicine, science and health; narratives of illness and identity change; linguistic accommodation between expert and client; language of agency and responsibility.\n- Legal professions: There are many ways that the skills and training of a linguist become relevant in legal contexts, including: teaching legal writing (training international lawyers to become ‘fluent’ writers in American legal genres), interpreting the complex language of statutes and contracts; analyzing ambiguity and presuppositions (e.g., in testimony or in cross-examination); elucidation of attitudes toward language in legal proceedings; linguistic analysis (of dialect features, writing or speaking style) in criminal investigations, ‘profile’ suspects in criminal investigations by analyzing dialect/speaking or writing style.\n- Education: Many graduates of linguistics become educators (at the primary, secondary or higher education levels, and within corporate and professional contexts). Training in linguistics can help teachers more effectively communicate with their students, to understand how language operates within the classroom and in the wider community. A teacher trained as a linguist is skilled at recognizing how language used in the classroom reflects and constructs social identities (such as gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, race, region, and class), or how knowledge of pragmatics (how language functions in context) can help teachers to identify critical elements of language which play a role in communicating meaning. Such knowledge can inform both the process and products of education, including how teachers design lectures and structure classroom interactions.\n- Business: An awareness of language and communication has a broad range of applications in the business world. Generally speaking, one of the most valuable skills that a linguist possesses is that of knowing how to use language accurately and persuasively. Linguists are trained to observe how language is used and interpreted in different contexts, which has been applied very productively in such fields as marketing, branding, and advertising.\n- Government: Many governmental organizations actively recruit linguists, particularly for translation, interpretation, and cultural analyses. Several graduates of Georgetown’s linguistics department have found rewarding opportunities within various governmental agencies by articulating the unique value of a linguist’s perspective.\nWhat professional skills does the study of linguistics cultivate?\nThe scientific study of language cultivates a number of skills and abilities including the following:\n- Heightened cultural awareness\n- Analytic reasoning skills\n- Ability to structure and support a logical argument\n- Ability to formulate and test hypotheses using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies\n- Insightful observation skills (e.g. identifying and unpacking presuppositions)\n- Powerful communication skills (designing a message for reception by specific audiences)\nWhat professional organizations exist for Linguists?\n- Linguist List linguistics\nWhere are graduates of the MLC currently working?\nAlums and current students in the MLC come from backgrounds in technical communication, diversity training, corporate and strategic communication, research, editing, publishing, writing, healthcare communication, translation, interpretation, and international education. The skills and training received as part of their graduate work with the MLC have led to further opportunities as grant writers; as HR, PR, Marketing, Branding, and Naming, and Technical Communication professionals; many work in education, including as Cross Cultural and Diversity Trainers, or for the Government including the Department of Justice, the Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DC Superior Courts, and the Pentagon. Additionally, every year, we do have a number of students who go on to pursue a PhD (in Linguistics, Education, Sociology, etc.) Please refer to our Alumni Pages for further details on featured alumni.\nWhat Career Services does Georgetown University have to offer?\n- The Georgetown University Career Education Center is a resource for Current students and alumni for up to three years after graduation.\n- Explore career options and search for job listings through the Hoya Career Connection.\n- Or find alumni working in your chosen field through the online alumni database.\nWhat other career development resources are available to me as a student in the MLC?\nA very valuable resource for MLCers is our relationship with the SFS’ graduate career center. Search for internship opportunities, find Georgetown alums who are working in your chosen field, participate in career development workshops, career fairs, and other professional development events on campus.\nHow do I market myself as a (socio)linguist?\nWe host a number of panels, workshops, and events every semester designed to familiarize our students with career options.\nWe invite professionals to speak about their own paths, providing networking opportunities and practice for our students in figuring out where their studies fit in the big picture. Additionally, the MLC Proseminar (offered in the Spring) is designed to help students conduct research into a professional area of interest. Class time is spent collaboratively brainstorming how one can pull together the skills being developed through linguistic coursework together with individual interests to create a total package for marketing yourself as a linguist. Please refer to this presentation given at the American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL) conference about career paths for linguists.\nThe MLC’s former director, Dr. Anna Marie Trester, writes about the intersection of linguistics and career at her website, Career Linguist.\nAre there any suggested readings as I prepare to conduct my career search?\nWe have found two books to be particularly useful for professionally-minded linguists, both of which are used in the MLC Professionalization Seminar (taught in the Spring):\n- Basalla, Susan and Maggie Debelius. 2007. “So What Are You Going to Do With That? Finding Careers Outside Academia.” Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.\n- Oaks, Dalin D. 1997. “Linguistics at Work: A Reader of Applications.” Mason, OH: Cengage.\nAnother very useful guide including career exploration activities for academics:\n- Newhouse, Margaret. 1993. “Outside the Ivory Tower: A Guide for Academics Considering Alternative Careers.” Office of Career Services: Harvard University.\nFinally, some very useful web-based articles:\n- “The Career-Savvy Grad student” from Cal Berkeley’s Career Center\n- “The View from Outside the Ivory Tower” by Alexandra Lord (from the American Historical Association’s Perspectives magazine)\nWhere can I search for jobs?\nPlease see our Job Search links for more information on finding a job."}

No I have ported the code to an Ultrascale+. I have a few errors on the HDLC link, so I have looked at the hdlc_tx_enable and hdlc_rx_data_valid signals on the scope. During 10 milliseconds they behave as expected (depending on the HDLC rate), then during 10 milliseconds they are constant zero, then again they behave as expected, ...\nThank you for your help\nxczu29dr-ffvf1760-2-e\n05-19-2020 11:11 PM\nHi tcachat@metraware.com,\nPlease try to run CPRI hardware demo design.\n05-27-2020 04:00 AM\nFYI tcachat@metraware.com\nIn CPRI Lounge : KCU105, VCU108 and ZCU102 boards are supported by CPRI demonstration designs. In older releases the KC705, ZC706, VC709, AC701, KCU105, VCU108 and ZCU102 boards are supported.\n06-18-2020 05:55 AM\nSorry for my late answer. I would prefer not to start from the demonstration design, because on the other side of the CPRI link my design is working well, and the demonstration design is quite different from mine.\nI have 2 boards linked by CPRI. The clocks synchronize well. The \"\"Status Code and Alarm Register (0x0)\"\" reads alternatively 0x0F and 0x11 on both sides, if I try to read every 10 ms (my reading is not perfectly synchronized). As written above, on the scope it seems that everything is good for 10 ms, then the link is down for 10 ms, alternatively. I can exchange HDLC data, when I am lucky.\n06-18-2020 06:36 AM\nI have output some debug signals. On the attached scope image,\nSo arround the end of a 10 ms chunk, I see local_lof, local_rai and stat_alarm high.\n06-18-2020 07:53 AM - edited 06-18-2020 07:56 AM\nI have changed my debug signals. Channels 0 to 7 are from the CPRI slave, 8 to 15 are from the master.\nand similarly from 8 to 15 for the master. So the local_lof and local_rai appears first on the slave side. Nevertheless it seems that the link works well for 10 ms. And my slave board works well with another master.\n08-06-2020 04:58 AM\nI have just tested further. I can even exchange IQ data, but only for 10 ms working, 10 ms off, and so on.\nCan anyone help?\n08-06-2020 05:26 AM\nWhich version are you using? If you try latest version CPRI, do you see this issue?\n08-06-2020 06:49 AM\nI use CPRI (8.10) and Vivado 2019.1.\n(note that with Vivado 2018.1 and CPRI 8.9 I have a design working well on the ZC706.)\nI observe also that the master changes the nodebfn_tx_nr, then 66.666 µs later (one hyperframe) the slave signals \"\"local_lof\"\", \"\" local_rai\"\" and so on. The link is down for 10 ms.\n08-06-2020 07:03 AM\nThe IP behavior changes between 2019.1 and 2018.1, due to a known issue :\n08-06-2020 07:18 AM\n08-07-2020 01:53 AM\nThe issue in 2018.1 is due to a shift in the rx strobe, which was driven to nodebfn_tx_strobe. It brings resync every 10ms.\nHow do you generate nodebfn_tx_strobe in your design? can you capture nodebfn_tx_nr, nodebfn_tx_stobe and iq_tx_enable signals?\n08-07-2020 02:36 AM\n08-07-2020 02:58 AM\nAs for the fact there is a known issue related to nodebfn_rx_strobe for slave core, can you upgrade your slave side to 2018.3 and later version? And then see if the issue is fixed or not.\n08-07-2020 06:58 AM\n08-18-2020 08:18 AM\nCan you capture iq_tx_enable, nodebfn_tx_*, nodebfn_rx_*, stat_code, basic_frame_first_word in the same ILA please?\n08-26-2020 06:40 AM - edited 08-26-2020 08:00 AM\n08-26-2020 07:59 AM\nOn the Master side, the nodebfn_tx seems correct\n08-28-2020 07:43 AM\nFollowing the above ILA pictures, I concentrated on the nodebfn_tx_*. Until now my iq_tx_gen.vhd was essentially the one of the IP Example Design, except for the IQ data, and it worked well with the ZC706. Yet on the master side I have tried to reset the bfn counter when the link is lost, and I get a different result (still unsatisfactory). In the below scope image, I have changed the signals on the master side:\nSignals on the slave side (0-7) are the same as above.\nI do not have periodically 10 ms up 10 ms down any more. One can observe that the slave loses the link (either for a short or a long time) just after the nodebfn_tx_nr_m changes. The master also loses the link for a short time. The picture can be different, with the master losing the link for a long time about 4 ms after the trig.\nThe link can stay down for more than 400 ms.\n09-01-2020 01:16 AM\nThe image doesn't look clear, when ILA is open, can you go to menu bar, click File -> Export ILA data, and then upload ila file.\n09-01-2020 01:26 AM\nFrom your last reply, 11 doesn't look correct to me, if it's nodebfn_tx_nr, it should be a number, not single bit logic, and it should last for 10ms. From the image, the falling edge comes earlier than 10ms, which causes stat_code loses sync.\n09-01-2020 04:31 AM\nPlease find attached the exported ILA records, with two examples for the slave side, and two for the master side. I came back the the 2020-08-26 version of the code (same as the ILA screenshot above).\nOn the (physical) scope, I am limited to 16 logic signals, so I chose only the LSB of nodebfn_tx_nr_m, which changes every 10 ms.\nPS: <<The attachment's cpri_slave.ila content type (application/octet-stream) does not match its file extension and has been removed.>> I hope a ZIP file is allowed...\n09-04-2020 07:54 AM - edited 09-04-2020 08:04 AM\nI notice there is problem with tx_nodebfn_strobe/nodebfn_rx_strobe_s in slave ILA. What's your ILA clock freq? I need to check if there is an issue with basic_frame_first_word, or the issue is to do generated iq_tx_enable.\nThe tx_strobe timing looks good in master ILA, but the nodebfn_rx_nr looks strange. I think we need to fix the timing in slave tx_nodebfn_strobe firstly.\nIf you want to use nodebfn_rx_strobe_s to drive nodebfn_tx_strobe_s, and iq_rx driven to iq_tx.\nPlease note there is one cycle difference between basic_frame_first_word/iq_rx and iq_tx_enable/iq_rx.\nCan you try to use independent tx_nodebfn_strobe on slave, and see if you can get expected iq_tx_enable? Please try this test on v2019.1.\n09-04-2020 09:35 AM\nDear @xud,\nmy ILA clock frequency is 153.6 MHz, it is the CPRI clock, the \"\"clk_out\"\" from the slave IP.\nIn the slave I used a simple\nnodebfn_tx_strobe_s <= nodebfn_rx_strobe_s;\nnodebfn_tx_nr_s <= nodebfn_rx_nr_s;\nNow I have tried to generate the nodebfn_tx_* independently. I still have the 10 ms toggle. Attached are tree ILA data on the slave side. The duration of the strobe seems better. Trying a few times, nodebfn_rx_nr_s goes to zero shortly after nodebfn_rx_strobe_s is active, and then the link is lost.\nI am using v2019.1\nThanks\n09-22-2020 02:48 AM\nYou are right, the problem is here. To be more precise, the previous iq_tx_enable are regularly spaced by 40 cycles, but the nodebfn_tx_strobe_m goes high to early, which probably breaks everything. My generation of nodebfn_tx_strobe_m was wrong (was done in advance). Strangely the same code worked well on the ZC706.\""}

Some prefer doing cardio exercises several times a week, while some like to lift weights to tone and build their muscles.

Rather, going slow is actually critical in maintaining your momentum so you will not feel tired easily. Also, make sure to practice proper breathing while doing the exercise. It is okay to do small movements rather than stretching all out – you are basically trying to warm up first before engaging in more challenging movements.\nFirst of all, this equipment was originally developed so that recovering patients can still exercise while bedridden. That said, it is used to keep fit and maintain body strength. Pilates practitioners say when they do the routine, they feel like “flying” due to the gliding motions.\nIt is important to know the basic parts of the reformer and how to use it correctly. For example, the reformer springs have different colors representing each of their resistance levels and stability. There is also a set of straps that can be used in various ways and has different lengths. The shorter straps aim to create tension and usually target the abs. On the other hand, the longer strap focuses more on stability and balance.\nOther Factors to Consider\nAside from the abovementioned characteristics of a good Pilates bar kit, there are other factors that can affect your purchase decision. Among these factors may include the following:\nIn the first place, this is the reason why you intend to buy the best Pilates bars around. Instead of buying a bulky Pilates reformer bed, an easy-to-carry Pilates bar should also do the job. It also has resistance straps that can work your stability, balance, flexibility, and strength.\nAn ideal Pilates bar kit should also have enough support for its users. For example, the bars should have a soft handle for easier and convenient grip. The resistance bands should also have a stable and durable hook or something where they can be attached to the bars. This is to prevent the straps from snapping off while in the middle of a Pilates session.\nAn ideal Pilates bar kit should also be used in other exercise routines. For example, it may be used as an alternative to weight lifting or to simply provide a total body workout. This makes it worth the money especially for those who want variety in their daily exercise routines.\nIt is also important that the Pilates bar kit is easily adjustable depending on personal preference. As mentioned, an ideal Pilates bar should also be versatile enough to be used in other exercise routines like body toning and the like.\nPilates is not just a simple exercise routine for weight loss. It also focuses on core strengthening and improves your muscle tone. If you want to focus on these areas without fear of bulking up unlike weight lifting, Pilates can be a great choice for you. Likewise, Pilates can also improve your flexibility and improving your spine alignment, similar to what yoga usually aims.\nPilates is generally an effective and safe exercise routine for all types of people. It focuses on the abs, lower back, hips, and thighs, although it can work out your entire body as well. While it has been more popular now in the fitness world, Pilates is still being practiced for rehabilitative purposes, in which it was originally intended for.\nFor example, Pilates is being practiced by professional athletes to improve their agility. On the other hand, it is also widely practiced among seniors to improve their posture and balance.\nAside from a yoga mat, other exercise equipment can be used in Pilates including bars or reformers. Such equipment will help users to stretch out their bodies, improve their flexibility and promote spine alignment. Aside from stretching exercises, you will also have to focus on proper breathing and controlling the movements that can release tension and make you feel better inside and out.\nAs mentioned, you can do Pilates using a mat or a reformer. A Pilates mat is basically thicker than a yoga mat aimed to cushion your pressure points. On the other hand, a reformer is a Pilates kit that includes a foot bar and pulleys aimed to provide resistance during your exercise routine.\nIf you choose to use a bar kit on your routine, you can consider the following factors so you can make the most out of your money.\nOf course, it is important to get a Pilates bar kit that you can use for years. Some may have warranties with them, others come at reasonable prices, while some come with various freebies. While some come cheaper than others, make sure that it is made with high-quality materials which can surely last for several uses. More than cheap price and countless features, the most important thing is that it should deliver results as you expect on a Pilates bar kit.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, it is possible to lose weight when you do Pilates reformer. However, it may require exerting more physical effort to take effect. Specifically, it would require around 3,500 calories to lose one pound. That said, you should take Pilates reformer seriously and devote several days a week in this exercise so you can get the weight loss results you want.\nFor one, the Pilates reformer offers several health benefits such as body flexibility and coordination, as well as improves balance and overall body strength. In the long run, it can also improve your posture and movement, and even reduce the feeling of body pains.\nAs per the rule of thumb, any type of exercise should require at least three times a week to achieve optimum results. The more frequent you do Pilates – or any exercise regimen for that matter – you can improve your strength, endurance, and flexibility. Plus, you can lose a couple of pounds in a few weeks if you couple it with a proper diet.\nAs mentioned, Pilates is really effective for toning your muscles, strengthening your core, and improving your body flexibility. However, it is important to note that Pilates is not cardio or aerobic exercise. That is why make sure to do separate cardio or aerobic exercise aside from Pilates to achieve maximum body and health results. However, Pilates can be a physically-demanding routine as well, so make sure to start slow and then gradually increase in intensity over the next few weeks.\nSince Pilates aims to improve overall body strength, it can be effective in improving conditions such as sciatica. In fact, there are Pilates moves that aim to help people with sciatic by building up deep muscles and offer support to the sciatic nerve, hence making the person feel better at least.\nFor one, such equipment like Pilates bar kits aims to improve your strength, flexibility, and balance. Unlike using no equipment, these types of exercise equipment will push you to the limit, to say the least. It will require extra effort to work with these types of equipment and achieve the results you want.\nIn doing Pilates, you are not required to wear shoes as you will mostly be required to go barefoot or wear socks the whole time. As for apparel, go for a tank top or a comfortable t-shirt paired with either cycling shorts, yoga pants, or any stretchable pants that allow free-flowing movement. Most of all, just enjoy the routine!\nSources\n- A Complete Guide to Conquering Pilates Machines, Jan 28, 2015,\n- How to Use a Pilates Reformer for Beginners, Jan 03, 2018,"}

{"id": "https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/atr-calculation.23836/", "text": "Hi. I am calculating ATR myself, and it works fine. Except, for the S&P EMINI contracts, atr shows, as an example, 3.44, or similar. Looking at other charting programs, at this time, the ATR is usually 1, or around 1. Do I need to adjust for the cost of each tick (.125)? Or, is my value ok? As a solid example, at 10:59 today (NY time), (open is 1033, close 1032.25), I have an ATR of 3.8611, on a 14 period lookback. Can someone point out what I am overlooking to get successful reading? Thanks."}

What should I do?\nIf you know what you are doing, you can install a swap file, however, for most people, we recommend you install a swap partition. The installer is a little bit conservative. If you have a lot of memory, you can limit your amount of swap, unless you really plan to run memory-intensive tasks. It all comes down to how heavily you want to use the machine."}
