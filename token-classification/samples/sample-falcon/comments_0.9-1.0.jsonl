A: Our season parallels the school year. It is scheduled in two halves: 8 games in September and October, and 8 in May and June.\nGames are typically on Saturdays, throughout the day. U5 through 8 also play on two Sunday afternoons in the fall, and two in the spring.\nU10 through U14 play mostly on Saturdays with occasional Sunday or weeknight games. The difference is because older age groups play with teams from other regions, not just within Flushing AYSO. U10 through U14 half-seasons sometimes start earlier or end later than those for younger players.\nQ: What equipment does my child need? A: You will need to purchase a uniform from Flushing AYSO (or use a hand-me-down, or find one at a garage sale). Shinguards are required. Your child should have a soccer ball of the correct size.\nChildren playing at the U8 level or higher will need cleats. Cleats are optional for younger players. Unfortunately, baseball cleats won’t work; they have an extra cleat in front that can interfere with kicking.\nBe sure to check out our Soccer Swap box, located near the concession stand. You can leave an outgrown ball, shinguards, cleats, uniform, or other equipment for someone else to use – or see if someone left just what you need.\nQ: What size ball do we need?A:\n* Ages are determined based on age on December 31 before the fall portion of the season.\nA: As of the 2015-2016 season, annual player registration is $70.00. Uniform cost varies over time, based on our cost from the supplier; typically uniforms are in the $60 range. There are two types of uniforms, one for U5-U10, and one for U12-U14.\nU12-U14: White socks with white jersey; black socks with orange jersey.\nQ: How does Flushing AYSO compare to travel soccer? A: Here are some of our thoughts:\nA: For all children in divisions U5, U6, and U-8 all games will be held on the age-appropriate fields at Seymour Elementary in Flushing. U10, U12, and U14 play home games at Seymour but will travel to other regions for some games.\nQ: As a coach, how do I contact the opposing coach to cancel or reschedule games?A: We will provide a listing of all coaches in the AYSO system.\nQ: What is the game cancellation policy?A: We do not cancel games for chilly weather, or rain without lightning. When we do, the most common reasons are weather that is dangerous (usually lightning), or fields that are so wet that play would severely damage them. When cancellations occur, sometimes a whole day’s games will be cancelled. Other times, they will be cancelled on an hour-by-hour basis, in hopes that part of the day can be salvaged.\nIn the rare event of a cancellation, we will announce it on the website and Facebook, and notify coaches, who will contact you. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume you’re playing. But it doesn’t hurt to check the website or Facebook right before your game. Reschedules of cancelled games are not automatic or required. Rescheduling is at both coaches’ discretion.\nQ: I haven’t heard from my coach. What do I do?A: We’re sorry! This can happen for a variety of reasons, not always under the coach’s control. Please contact us to let us know, and we will get you hooked up.\nP.O. Box 127 Flushing, Michigan 48433\""}

Some say have a life of three years and some say five years?\nAlso how Reliable Is Seagate Hard Drives? I hear Seagate hard drives internal or external are not that reliable and only last two or three years. Where western digital is more reliable?\nHow long internal or external hard drives last?\n31 Answers\nWhat you're looking for is a stat called MTBF. That means Mean Time between Failure. It gives you an idea in hours how long your disk drive is liable to last. Then you work out how many hours a day you run your computer and can calculate a life expectancy from there. If you want longer lasting hard drives, consider \"\"Server grade\"\", they may cost a little more but they are designed with the intent of running 24/7 for a few years. To be more specific, your life expectancy depends heavily on how many hours a day you run your machine. So if it said MTBF = 20,000 hours, and you ran your machine 24 hours a day, that under 3 years. But if you run it 3 hours a day, it might last up to 18 years.\nDepending on the HDD will depend on it's warranted life. Normal HDD's are warranted to last for 3 years although they can last much longer. Certain specialised HDD's, like Seagate's Iron Wolf Pro, are warranted for 5 years.\nAll HDD's can last for a very long time. Keep in mind that the 3 year or 5 year warranty is based on 24/7/365 usage so that is why they tend to last for much longer because most users do not utilise the same HDD perpetually.\nIn terms of which is more reliable, it is based on personal experience. I've found Seagate to be more reliable than any other brand including Western Digital. The only time I choose another brand is with SSD's in which case, I choose Samsung.\nSadly, there is no real guarantee which drive will last longer or will be more reliable as it depends on the environment it is used in and the user. Sometimes you may be the unlucky receiver of an 'out of box failure' (OBF) which is a dead device.Source(s): 15 Years specialised experience in the industry\n- 2 months ago\ndepends on their use I think. I have had the same one for about 10 years now and just added a second as the first was finally almost full. Still have about 15 gigs left on it it is a 250.\n'\nI Just added a second Sata Drive of 2 TB as I am checking out XBOX PASS for PC and need the extra storage for a few games I plan on adding. Like Microsoft Flight Sim 2020 to go along with My DCS which I have used for about 6 or 7 years now.\n'\nI have also made a clone backup of my main drive in case of a failure.. IT does not make any more noise than normal at this time BUt I rather have a good cloned backup with everything on it than to have to try to reinstall all my programs etc. from backups or cloud etc. ITS easy to Make a clone and just keep it updated and IF There is a failure all I have to do is SWITCH OUT HD..\n'\nI Also DO NOT TURN my computer on and off.. IT stays on 24/7 unless I have to do a restart for something as I think restarting., on and off adds to wear and tear of it.\n- What do you think of the answers? You can sign in to give your opinion on the answer.\nThe answer depends on the types of hard drive and how long they run during a day. I am excluding Solid State Drives from this as they are not hard drives. Servers use enterprise class drives that last longer (or more hours of use) than other drives. This is a requirement of their function. The specifications for drives will state mean time to failure for the drives and this is a good indication, comparatively, of the length of service one can expect to get from a drive. As far as Companies, both Western Digital and Seagate are name brands these days. My preferences is for Western Digital as I have never had one fail yet. But if I was always to have used Seagate, I might be able to say the same about them. I think Seagate had some firmware issues several years ago which may have tainted their name to some people.\nAs far as internal or external, the drive themselves should last the same length of time if the drives are identical and operating conditions are the same. I guess as a general rule, if you had to say, internal may last longer because their operating environment is often better and they might be subject to fewer knocks and bumps especially if the drive is being use during traveling.\nEDIT: As a side note, because I am reading some of the other comments about SSDs, SSDs do have a fixed lifespan, based on read and write cycles. They will fail, or more accurately, be used up, in a fixed length of time.\nI had a Maxtor IDE hard drive last me 15 years. My first Seagate lasted all but a year before it died. All of my hard drives today are all 7200 RPM Western Digital drives, and man oh man, they are really reliable.\nI don't own any solid state drives, so I don't know their lifespan, but I have heard that things you can do with a standard, mechanical hard drive, if you try to do the same with a solid state drive, it will lower the life span of the solid state drive.\nI have an external WD 7200 hard drive as well, and that has lasted me 5+ years so far. It's just a backup drive for my E:\\ drive, where all of my games are installed to, so it just sits up in my closet in the motherboard box.\nEDIT: Just to add, I stay away from Seagate. I never saw them as being reliable.\nOld fashioned electro mechanical hard drives last 5 to 10 years depending on the amount of use the computer gets.\nNewer Solid State hard drives have no moving parts and should in theory last indefinitely.\nBy the time you've had a computer about 5 years though the manufacturer will begin to drop support for it and repairs will become more difficult. So that tends to be the factor that makes people sell on and upgrade.\nI replace my internal hard drives because they ran out of space. When bought brand new, I've had very few problems with Seagate. Western Digital is also a good brand. The problems I've had with internal hard drives happen when I bought them secondhand so I don't know exactly how abused they were in the past. I assume problems occur due to storage as I've noticed that when bought secondhand, the drives aren't handled carefully at all.\nI've been into external drives for just a couple of years and so far, I have no problems with them yet. I've been buying branded ones only from Seagate and Western Digital.\""}

In April 2020 the Round 5 results were announced, with a further 182 base stations to be funded in regional and remote Australia.\nRounds 1 and 2\nUnder Rounds 1 and 2 of the Mobile Black Spot Program, 765 mobile base stations are being deployed across the country to improve mobile coverage in regional and remote Australia. The indicative locations of these base stations can be viewed on the National Map.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including lists of the base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the department's website.\nInformation about the expected timing of the rollout of the 765 mobile base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the Optus, Telstra and Vodafone websites:\nThe rollout sequence is being determined by the mobile carriers based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThese rollout schedules will be regularly updated as the rollout progresses. such as trees interrupting the line-of-sight from the mobile base station.\nThe particular handset used can also affect mobile reception. Each of the mobile phone providers are able to provide advice on the best handsets for local conditions. For example, Telstra uses a 'blue tick' label on the phones it recommends for use in poor coverage areas. Optus uses a 'Top Picks for Regional Coverage' device rating program, enabling consumers to choose mobile phones that will work best on the Optus regional network.\nNew products to improve mobile reception are regularly released. For example, Telstra has released a 'Smart Antenna' to improve indoor reception on its network, and Wi-Fi calling is available on mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device allowing some customers to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. Another effective way to improve reception is to use an external antenna or in-car kit, particularly if travelling on regional roads. The most appropriate antenna may depend upon the network, and prices can vary. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and recognised dealers.\nThe mobile network operators and mobile network infrastructure providers were asked to come forward with proposals to build new or upgraded mobile base stations to deliver improved mobile coverage to locations on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nApplications were received from Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. All proposed base stations included in the applications were assessed and ranked according to the assessment criteria outlined in the Round 1 and Round 2 program guidelines.\nThe application process awarded ranking points to base stations based on how they performed against the assessment criteria. The Department recommended base stations for funding based on the assessment against the criteria including value for money. The assessment criteria included consideration of the:\n- expected coverage that each base station would deliver\n- number of premises and the length of major transport routes being covered\n- total cost of the base stations\n- amount of Commonwealth funding being sought\n- amount of funding the mobile network operator/mobile network infrastructure provider was proposing to co-contribute\n- amount of co-contribution secured from a third party such as a state or local government.\nRound 2 of the program also included a new handheld coverage requirement— ten square kilometres for macrocell base stations and five square kilometres for small cells. The Government funded all eligible Round 2 base stations that met this requirement.\nThere were additional base stations that did not meet this coverage requirement but were ranked highly against the assessment criteria. The Round 2 guidelines provided the department with flexibility to consider these base stations if other benefits justified funding.\nThe department recommended a number of base stations with smaller new handheld coverage outcomes because these were ranked highly against the criteria and offered benefits to the community. For example:\n- A base station may provide a small amount of coverage but this may be to a small town and may be low cost.\n- A base station may address a known black spot where it is not possible to achieve a large coverage outcome because of the terrain, such as in a valley or in a geographically hilly area.\nThe Department's assessment against the program criteria indicated that application of the coverage requirement would in some cases exclude highly ranked base stations. For these reasons, and consistent with the guidelines, these base stations were recommended for funding.\nPriority Locations round\nThe Government announced the outcomes of the Priority Location round of the program on 5 April 2018, including a total of $82.8 million in new investment to address the mobile coverage issues at the priority locations.\nAll 125 identified priority locations will now receive improved mobile coverage as a result of direct investment from the Government and the mobile carriers.\nThe rollout timing is available on the mobile carriers' websites.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including the guidelines and the list of sites under the Priority Locations round of the program, is available on the Mobile Black Spot Program page.\nA list of all the priority locations with a description of the solution at each location is available in the 125 eligible priority locations document.\nThe nominated locations were announced by the Government as part of the Federal Election in 2016. The locations nominated have been identified as areas with poor or no mobile coverage, which had not at that time had their coverage issues resolved under the program.\nThe rollout sequence for each round of the Mobile Black Spot Program is determined by the mobile network operators based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThe rollout schedules are regularly updated on the carriers' websites as the rollout progresses.\nRound 4\nOn 18 March 2019, the Minister for Regional Services, Senator the Hon Bridget McKenzie, announced the outcomes of the Round 4 competitive assessment process. Round 4 of the Program will deliver 180 new mobile base stations (49 Optus and 131 Telstra) to address more coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 4 of the Program targets regional and remote black spot locations, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers are invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 4 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 4.\nRound 4 base stations are currently being rolled out across the country, due to be complete by Q2 2020. However, base station constructions can be subject to delays for a variety of reasons outlined below. Refer to the mobile carriers' websites for more details and updates on the rollout.\n73 base stations will specifically target coverage issues at Public Interest Premises, such as tourist sites and emergency services facilities.\nA Public Interest Premises is defined as a premises or location that the Program considers is used on a continuing basis for a public interest purpose, and which may include:\n- an economic centre\n- an emergency services facility\n- a health facility\n- an educational facility\n- an indigenous community organisation\n- a local government facility\n- a not-for-profit organisation.\nRound 5\nIn April 2020, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, The Hon Paul Fletcher MP, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government, The Hon Mark Coulton MP, announced the results of the Round 5 competitive assessment process.\nRound 5 will deliver 182 new mobile base stations (two from Field Solutions Group, 83 from Optus and 97 from Telstra) to continue to address coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 5 of the Program targeted regional and remote areas, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers were invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 5 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 5.\nThe rollout is expected to commence shortly, with the first new base stations being activated by the second half of the year.\nIn April 2020 the Government released a discussion paper seeking feedback from industry and community on options for the design of a Round 5A of the Program.\nFunding for Round 5A will be drawn from the unused portion of the funding allocated to Round 5 to expand and improve mobile coverage for regional and remote Australia.\nFurther information can be found on the Round 5A 'Have your say' page, Consultation on design options for Round 5A of the Mobile Black Spot Program.\nRound 6\nThe Government has committed $80 million in funding to a Round 6 of the Program, which will commence following Round 5A.\nGeneral\nThe National Mobile Black Spot Database closed for nominations on 11 October 2018, although locations not on the database can still be funded. New nominations are not being accepted at this time.\nThe Government has committed $380 million to the Mobile Black Spot Program to invest in telecommunications infrastructure to extend and improve mobile phone coverage and competition across six rounds of the program.\nAdditionally, we are encouraging the mobile network operators to continue their investment in their regional mobile networks.\nBase stations that have been delayed\nBase station deployment is a complex process that typically takes between 12 and 18 months to complete. A number of separate phases are involved including site inspection, detailed design, planning approvals, site acquisition, construction and final activation.\nAs well as the mobile network operator building the base station, a number of external parties are directly and indirectly involved in the deployment process. These other parties include land owners, local communities, local councils, state government departments, power authorities, other mobile network operators, equipment manufacturers and infrastructure providers.\nPlanning approvals and site acquisition in particular are subject to external processes that are typically outside of the direct control of the mobile network operators.\nIn some instances, these external factors may impact the delivery timeframe for a base station. For example, additional fauna or flora surveys may be required before local planning approval is granted, or negotiations with land owners may take longer than anticipated.\nThe mobile network operators are committed to working through issues as they arise. The program remains focused in delivering new coverage as soon as possible.\nInformation about the expected timing for individual base stations can be found on the mobile network operators' and infrastructure providers' websites: Field Solutions Group, Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. The mobile network operators and infrastructure providers regularly update their rollout schedules as the rollout progresses.\nBase stations that are no longer required or cannot be built\nIn a small number of cases a base station is no longer required as the coverage that the base station would have provided is now being delivered by one or more other funded base stations nearby.\nReasons why a base station cannot be built vary, but can include difficulty in obtaining planning approval for a base station at the original scheduled location, difficulty reaching agreement with the land owner/s to use the site, as well as unforeseen technical issues with integrating the base station into the existing mobile network.\nBefore declaring that a base station cannot be built at its scheduled location, the mobile network operator will explore all options to provide new and improved coverage to the location, including investigating alternative sites.\nIn some cases the carrier has been able to enhance another base station in the area to meet the coverage requirements of the originally planned base station.\nIf the mobile network operator has exhausted all options and a planned base station cannot be built at its original scheduled location, then funding for the original base station can be used to fund an alternative site.\nIn this situation, the mobile network operator is required to propose a new site that will offer new handheld mobile coverage to another nominated mobile black spot location that is included on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nState government approval of the proposed alternative site is required if the original scheduled site is co-funded by the state.\nThe following base stations have been approved as alternative sites and will now be funded under the program:\n- Beachmere North, QLD\n- Boggabri, NSW\n- Boondooma, QLD\n- Bryant Road, (Marchagee East), WA\n- Burringurrah, WA\n- Cape Hillsborough, QLD\n- Carcoar, NSW\n- Charleroi, VIC\n- Denbarker, WA\n- Duke of Orleans (Caravan Park), WA\n- Girard Hilltop, NSW\n- Goldie, VIC\n- Gollan, NSW\n- Graytown, VIC\n- Guluguba, QLD\n- Honeymoon Bay, WA\n- Jiggi, NSW\n- Jurien East, WA\n- Kalannie North, WA\n- Kanmantoo, SA\n- Keswick Island, QLD\n- Kingsford, WA\n- Lake Magenta, WA\n- Lingara, NT\n- Muirs Highway, Dingup, WA\n- Mulan, WA\n- North Dorrigo, NSW\n- Orpheus Island, QLD\n- Parnngurr, WA\n- Rainbow Valley, NT\n- Ravensthorpe North, WA\n- Tabulam, NSW\n- Tintaldra, VIC\n- Traralgon South, VIC\n- William Bay, WA\n- Wilroy, WA\n- Wyndham, NSW.\nThe following base stations are no longer required to be built under the Program as one or more funded base stations nearby are now able to provide coverage to the scheduled black spot area:\n- Bonalbo B, NSW\n- Lower Peacock, NSW\n- Ocean Beach, WA\nThe following base stations cannot be built under the program due to unforeseen technical or site acquisition issues.

Recently, the Lodges at Calistoga Ranch, a luxury fractional offering in Napa Valley, extended us such an invitation, and we spent a weekend on the property enjoying their hospitality.\nMost aging boomers have dreamed, at one time or another, of giving up the rat race, buying a plot of land in the wine country, settling in with a stack of books and a pair of work gloves to make the next great vintage. Unfortunately, the price of land in places like the Napa Valley have made that dream impossible for all but a select few hedge fund managers, retired CEOs, and trustafarians. Lately however, the rise of fractional ownership has resurrected the dream making it available once again to the merely affluent.\nHalogen Guides was recently the guest of one such fractional ownership development, Napa’s Calistoga Ranch. Ownership at the resort cum fractional offering may not be exactly the same as holding a sprawling vineyard, but it does a fine job of serving up a slice of the idle elegance of Napa living.\nThe Lay of the Land\nCalistoga Ranch’s aura of intimacy and relaxation is due in no small to by the resort’s topography: a protected gently sloping canyon whose mouth extends from a northeast corner of the Napa valley. The resort’s 157 acres, populated by oaks and peregrinating families of deer, features several hiking trails which afford sweeping views of the vineyards in the valley below.\nOperated by Auberge Resorts, whose Auberge de Soleil has more or less served as the ne plus ultra of Napa Valley chic for more than a generation, the Calistoga Ranch presents a different, but no less sophisticated aesthetic. Where the Auberge de Soleil channels Provence with its stucco and saffron motif, Calistoga Ranch presents a less embellished, if somewhat prosaic, naturalist design vision. The emphasis here is on complimenting, not upstaging, the land.\nWhat’s For Sale\nThe detached 3,000 square foot shingled owners lodges dotting the hillside afford a surprising amount of privacy, even as they each feature large enclosed outdoor living areas connecting the various modules: kitchen, living room, master and guest bedroom. With their outdoor fire places, grills, and comfortable furniture, these atriums are a inviting and natural space, serving as the lodges’ focal point. Muted tans, creams, and ocher colors go well with the stained wood floors. While the design might be lacking somewhat in terms of personality and spontaneity, the overall effect is tasteful and refined: a more than adequate compensation, and one which is well suited to the reality of shared ownership.\nThe master bedrooms feature well appointed bathrooms with large tubs and showers, his and her faucets, and ample closet space. Owners are likely to take frequent advantage of the outdoor showers just off the master bathroom for a sensuous pleine air pick-me-up. Here again, the evident thought that went into preserving the privacy of each lodge is much appreciated.\nAppliances and amenities throughout lodges are all first rate: flat screen televisions, high-end stereo, Viking range and refrigerators in the well stocked kitchen, soft robes, to go along with fine linens and tastefully chosen furniture.\nWhat You Get\nThe resort’s restaurant, at the top of the trail winding up the canyon serves up delicious Cal-cuisine fare. Enjoying a meal on the terrace there, overlooking a beautiful pond, with a glass of Pinot in hand is an experience that I wouldn’t expect anyone to tire from too quickly.\nThe same could be said for Calistoga Ranch’s tranquil spa, where any number of expertly administered treatments are available. The pool, which overlooks the resort’s own vineyards, is ideal for sun-soaked Napa summer days. While the die hard gym nuts will likely need to go elsewhere for their power lifts, the work out facilities are more than adequate for those of us trying to work off that extra piece of tiramisu.\nWhile the promotional nature of our trip made it difficult to objectively gauge the level of service at Calistoga Ranch, the guests and members I spoke with all confirmed the same alacrity and superior consideration from the concierge and staff.\nThe Halogen Guides Take\nThere’s no denying that this level of luxury doesn’t come cheap, and it is difficult to make the case for ownership strictly as a value proposition. At $475,000 for a one tenth fraction (not to mention the yearly dues) , one wonders whether the owners’ lodges are in fact worth $4.75 million each, particularly when one considers that the lodges though luxurious are constructed from prefab units. At the same time, it’s not likely you could find much more than a shack in the valley anywhere north of the city of Napa for less than $500,000. Likewise it’s worth considering that the nightly rate for the same type of lodges for Calistoga Ranch’s resort guests go for as much as $3,200 in the high season.\nFor those considering ownership it’s best to approach Calistoga Ranch less as a real estate opportunity than as a lifestyle investment, not normally available to the general public. The club’s Vintner Program, for one, allows members exclusive access to a variety of the finest wineries in the valley, from legendary vintners like Robert Mondavi to “cult” wine makers like the Grace Family Vineyards. Privileges include private tours and yearly parties at each of the 39 vintner partners’ plots. Oenophile owners can also store their wine in Calistoga Ranch’s expansive cave, for optimal preservation.\nThere are daily activities always on offer: everything from yoga, tai chi, painting classes, or for the less ambitious, mojito-making seminars. Is it worth the price tag? As with anything else, that all depends on what you value. What we can say is that Calistoga Ranch is a positively charming place, which we would return to again and again. For those looking to buy a piece of the languorous romance that is the Napa valley, and with liberal budgets, we would give Calistoga Ranch our hearty recommendation.\nFrom: MagicOPromotionTuesday, May, 05, 2009 at 08:09 AM\nWell...

Are there others among the 30 who are simply part of a postwar reconstruction effort?\nMr. Boucher: Many of these people are associated somehow militarily with the action. I think most, almost all is probably a better description. Some of them, like Japan, are probably exclusively interested in the post-conflict situation and helping out if we get to that, but I think most of these others, if you look at what they, themselves, have said, are in some ways willing or participating in, or supporting potential conflict, if that's where it ends up.\nQuestion: And two, I know you don't want to get into specifics of what each country would offer, but at least two countries on this list kind of jump out at me in terms of their abilities to do anything, and that would be Afghanistan and Ethiopia.When you need to pad your list with Eritrea then you don't have a coalition.

They may not be providing a specific resource, or they may just be allowing access, overflight, or other participation in that way, or they may just have decided they want to be publicly associated with the effort to disarm Iraq. Remember, that is the fundamental of this, that these are countries who have all stood up and said it is time to disarm Iraq, and if Iraq doesn't do that peacefully, we need to be prepared to do it by whatever means are necessary -- people that are associating themselves in public with the effort to make sure that Iraq is disarmed and disarmed soon.\nQuestion: Did -- I assume that you asked everybody in the world whether they were willing to go on this list, and therefore you had 160 rejections, were there?Boucher says no. He's probably right, the number is probably like 120 rejections, after all we already knew what France, Russia, etc. would say."}

{"id": "https://www.huberwood.com/blog/qa-on-zip-system-r-sheathing-with-green-builder-carl-seville", "text": "Q&A on ZIP System® R-sheathing with Green Builder Carl Seville\n.jpg)\nQ: Let’s start with SK Collaborative. Tell us about your firm.\nA: We are a green building consulting and certification company. We certify single and multifamily projects under all green building programs including LEED for Homes and Neighborhood Development, EarthCraft House, National Green Building Standard, ENERGY STAR, and Enterprise Green Communities. We also provide professional training, and curriculum and technical writing for the construction industry. We provide certification services throughout the eastern US in both the affordable and market rate sectors.\nQ: You’re a leading authority on single- and multi-family green building. How do you work with homeowners, architects and manufacturers to create better buildings and products?\nA: Working with our clients from as early in the design process as possible, we recommend products and systems that will help our clients’ building perform better while maintaining budget pressures. We provide energy modeling services to assist in determining the most appropriate products for each project, weighing building envelope and system efficiencies for highest performance.\nQ: Talk to us about the building science of managing condensation within walls, and why this is important for professionals or homeowners seeking to build an energy efficient home?\nA: The key to managing condensation is a combination of air sealing and vapor retarders where appropriate. Air leakage is the main cause of interstitial condensation – either from the exterior or the interior, depending on the climate. In most US climates, vapor retarders are not recommended in walls since walls tend to dry to both the interior and exterior, depending on the season. In extreme cold climates with limited or no air conditioning, vapor retarders can help avoid condensation in walls. In moderate climates, air sealing, particularly from the exterior using products such as ZIP System® sheathing and tape, helps keep airborne vapor out of structures.\nQ: How do prescriptive code changes in the 2015 IECC guidelines address the issue of thermal bridging which impacts energy efficiency?\nA: The 2015 IECC requires continuous insulation for thermal and moisture management in exterior wall cavities using the prescriptive path in climate Zones 6 and above. In Zones 3, 4 and 5, using continuous insulation with R-13 cavity insulation allows for a thinner wall than meeting the requirement of R-20 in a cavity. Using foam insulation helps keep the interior surface of the sheathing warm in cold weather, reducing the possibility of condensation on this surface, between the insulation and the sheathing. Cold sheathing without continuous insulation has a high risk of interstitial condensation of any vapor moving from the interior of a home through the exterior walls. In a typical wood framed wall without exterior continuous insulation, thermal bridging occurs at each stud, plate, and header, reducing the effective overall R value of the wall well below the rated value of the cavity insulation. By adding a layer of continuous insulation, the thermal bridging is eliminated improving the overall efficiency of the wall higher than the rated value of the cavity insulation.\nQ: How long have you used products from Huber Engineered Woods? How about ZIP System R-sheathing and tape, specifically?\nA: I have seen and worked with AdvanTech® sheathing for many years. My first experience with ZIP System sheathing and tape was during the renovation of my current house in 2013. I used it on the exterior walls and roof and was very pleased with the weather and air barrier properties. The house I am currently building will use ZIP System® R-sheathing with built-in R-3 insulation on the exterior walls, and ZIP System® sheathing on the roof and on the top of the second floor ceiling joists; this is a passive house style technique that will allow me to create a complete air seal on the exterior surface of the walls and ceiling, avoiding problems with ceiling penetrations, such as lights.\nQ: What building methods did you use before you made the switch?\nA: The last house I built used OSB on corners where needed for structure and ½” XPS on all other exterior walls. Prior to this new home, I typically used or suggested my clients use spray foam on rooflines to create a well sealed building envelope. This project will be using ductless HVAC systems, eliminating the need for a conditioned attic. In this project, I will be using fiberglass insulation, limiting the use of spray foam to miscellaneous sealants.\nQ: How has using ZIP System® R-sheathing and tape changed your approach to designing and building the outer shell, or building envelope, of homes?\nA: ZIP System R-sheathing allows builders to create a tight building envelope prior to installation of drywall. With the appropriate design, it is possible to test for envelope leakage before any insulation or drywall is installed, identifying leaks before it is too late to seal them properly.\nQ: Why is a product like R-sheathing – that provides structure, thermal resistance, air leakage protection and moisture resistance – a “game changer” for green home construction?\nA: In any situation where continuous insulation is necessary or desired, the one step method using ZIP System R-sheathing is significantly simpler and less costly than installing multiple layers of OSB and foam to achieve the same results. In addition, eliminating the separate weather barrier further reduces installation cost.\nQ: Why did you choose this product for this particular house? (Or, what type of impact do you expect R-sheathing to have on the performance of this home?)\nA: LEED and ENERGY STAR certification require either advanced framing or continuous insulation. I will be incorporating both, however even the most advanced framing cannot eliminate all thermal bridging, so the use of continuous insulation will make a well-insulated a building envelope as is practical in my relatively mild Zone 3 climate. Traditionally, continuous insulation is installed on top of a home’s structural sheathing in separate steps, requiring multiple trips for the crew around the building. One step to install the sheathing, another to install the rigid insulation, and another to install the weather barrier. Using ZIP System R-sheathing allows a crew to install the insulation, structural sheathing and weather barrier in a single step.\nQ: What are the benefits of using R-sheathing in a southern market compared to its insulation benefits in northern climates?\nA: In cold climates, installing continuous insulation such as R-sheathing can significantly reduce thermal bridging at framing members, significantly improving the overall thermal performance of exterior walls, particularly during periods of severe cold. The benefits of R-sheathing are not as significant in warmer climates, nor during moderate weather in cold climates, since the delta T (temperature differential) between the interior and exterior are relatively small. There are moderate benefits year round, and the combination of continuous insulation and comprehensive air sealing will help maintain indoor temperature during severe cold weather. R-sheathing provides a level of passive survivability should a home lose electricity during a severe cold snap.\nQ: Why did you decide to certify the house as LEED Version 4?\nA: The city I live in, Decatur GA, included a requirement for green certification for all new buildings and major renovations in a comprehensive development ordinance adopted recently. Options for homes include LEED, EarthCraft, and NGBS. Having done numerous projects in the second two programs, and several LEED V2009 projects, I decided it would be educational to certify under LEED V4, before we are asked to provide this service for our clients. Having been one of the main contributors to the LEED reference guide, it is interesting to now be using it to certify my own house. There are some significant improvements in the new program – obviously the USGBC learned from their experience with the earlier version. I will likely also certify under EarthCraft and NGBS as well.\nFor more information on ZIP System R-sheathing, watch the video below or visit ZIPSystem.com/R-sheathing.

To be \"\"isolationist\"\" is to not want to be obliged to participate in wars between other nations, e.g. if France and Germany go to war, you don't want to be forced to participate on either side. Remember, the general perception at the close of the First World War was that the war had started over a silly local thing -- the assassination of the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist, and only became general because of the great web of mutual treaty obligations that sucked the remaining Great Powers into the war, e.g. once Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, the Russians (traditional defenders of Serbia) felt obliged to declare war on Austria-Hungary, and then Germany (obliged to Austria-Hungary by treaty) had to declare war on Russia, and then England and France (obliged to Russia by treaty) had to declare war on Germany, and then Austria-Hungary had to declare war on France and England. That's certainly oversimlified. There are plenty of ways the nations could have turned aside from war had they really wanted to, treaty obligations or not. But it has enough kernel of truth to make some American politicians extremely wary of gettling tangled up in mutual treaty obligations for the defense of one European nation against another. That all changed after the Second World War, because war was no longer restricted to continents.

At some period during the day, the http website can not be accessed\nat all. http page are very slow (like 10 to 30 seconds to appear).\nRead the access log : each access log read, but no solution.\nEnsure sql-connect : all sql querries are open and closed properly.\nTOP : viewing the processes, when nothing goes well, we notice that the\nhttpd process consume 15 to 30% of the CPU. We are mas-o-menos sure\nthat the problem take its source from there.\nYou experience in that domain will help us so much.\nThanks : many thanks for your answer.\nHenry"}
