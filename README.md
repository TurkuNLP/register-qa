# register-qa

Repository for finding questions and answers from texts using register identification as well as for splitting texts to questions and answers using multiple methods such as rule-based things and token classification.

<!-- was there are a difference in metrics? I don't remember so hmm, might have to explore this a bit for some paper since it is weird that there were only a handful that were predicted the same when comparing multi-label and multi-class -->

<!-- TODO:

- had problems with the dataset and tokenization, text field was missing for some english data (train at least) 
NOW I FILTER THEM AWAY IF THERE IS NO TEXT FIELD IN THE CODE
-> mention to Veronika, I might have had this problem already last summer(?) -->
