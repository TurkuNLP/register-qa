The data used to train the register model:

[CORE-corpus](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/CORE-corpus), [FinCORE_full](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/FinCORE_full/releases/tag/v1.0) and [Swedish](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/multilingual-register-data/tree/main/SweCORE/files-with-mt) and [French](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/multilingual-register-data/tree/main/FreCORE/files-with-mt) data from [multilingual-register-data](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/multilingual-register-data).

Map all QA related sublabels under one label, although they may be in different upper level categories. i.e. turn QA into an upper level label and include there QA, FA, FI, FH. This is done via sub_register_map in the script. Use upper labels with QA_NEW when doing multi-label and use only NOT_QA and QA_NEW when doing multiclass (which is miles better when looking at the predictions for some reason).
