At this point we are using a SPAN (mirror) port on the switch to listen to the traffic. Is it possible to use a network tap with winpcap? I assume that winpcap sees the network as two separate network interfaces. Do I just need to open both interfaces and then in my software merge the packets into the same stream? Or is there more to it than that? Thanks in advance"}, {"t": " Athir -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed... URL:"}], "text_plain": "Hello.
