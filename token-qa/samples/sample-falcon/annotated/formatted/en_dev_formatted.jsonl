In April 2020 the Round 5 results were announced, with a further 182 base stations to be funded in regional and remote Australia.\nRounds 1 and 2\nUnder Rounds 1 and 2 of the Mobile Black Spot Program, 765 mobile base stations are being deployed across the country to improve mobile coverage in regional and remote Australia. The indicative locations of these base stations can be viewed on the National Map.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including lists of the base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the department's website.\nInformation about the expected timing of the rollout of the 765 mobile base stations funded under Rounds 1 and 2 of the Program is available on the Optus, Telstra and Vodafone websites:\nThe rollout sequence is being determined by the mobile carriers based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThese rollout schedules will be regularly updated as the rollout progresses. such as trees interrupting the line-of-sight from the mobile base station.\nThe particular handset used can also affect mobile reception. Each of the mobile phone providers are able to provide advice on the best handsets for local conditions. For example, Telstra uses a 'blue tick' label on the phones it recommends for use in poor coverage areas. Optus uses a 'Top Picks for Regional Coverage' device rating program, enabling consumers to choose mobile phones that will work best on the Optus regional network.\nNew products to improve mobile reception are regularly released. For example, Telstra has released a 'Smart Antenna' to improve indoor reception on its network, and Wi-Fi calling is available on mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device allowing some customers to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. Another effective way to improve reception is to use an external antenna or in-car kit, particularly if travelling on regional roads. The most appropriate antenna may depend upon the network, and prices can vary. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and recognised dealers.\nThe mobile network operators and mobile network infrastructure providers were asked to come forward with proposals to build new or upgraded mobile base stations to deliver improved mobile coverage to locations on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nApplications were received from Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. All proposed base stations included in the applications were assessed and ranked according to the assessment criteria outlined in the Round 1 and Round 2 program guidelines.\nThe application process awarded ranking points to base stations based on how they performed against the assessment criteria. The Department recommended base stations for funding based on the assessment against the criteria including value for money. The assessment criteria included consideration of the:\n- expected coverage that each base station would deliver\n- number of premises and the length of major transport routes being covered\n- total cost of the base stations\n- amount of Commonwealth funding being sought\n- amount of funding the mobile network operator/mobile network infrastructure provider was proposing to co-contribute\n- amount of co-contribution secured from a third party such as a state or local government.\nRound 2 of the program also included a new handheld coverage requirement ten square kilometres for macrocell base stations and five square kilometres for small cells. The Government funded all eligible Round 2 base stations that met this requirement.\nThere were additional base stations that did not meet this coverage requirement but were ranked highly against the assessment criteria. The Round 2 guidelines provided the department with flexibility to consider these base stations if other benefits justified funding.\nThe department recommended a number of base stations with smaller new handheld coverage outcomes because these were ranked highly against the criteria and offered benefits to the community. For example:\n- A base station may provide a small amount of coverage but this may be to a small town and may be low cost.\n- A base station may address a known black spot where it is not possible to achieve a large coverage outcome because of the terrain, such as in a valley or in a geographically hilly area.\nThe Department's assessment against the program criteria indicated that application of the coverage requirement would in some cases exclude highly ranked base stations. For these reasons, and consistent with the guidelines, these base stations were recommended for funding.\nPriority Locations round\nThe Government announced the outcomes of the Priority Location round of the program on 5 April 2018, including a total of $82.8 million in new investment to address the mobile coverage issues at the priority locations.\nAll 125 identified priority locations will now receive improved mobile coverage as a result of direct investment from the Government and the mobile carriers.\nThe rollout timing is available on the mobile carriers' websites.\nFurther information on the Mobile Black Spot Program, including the guidelines and the list of sites under the Priority Locations round of the program, is available on the Mobile Black Spot Program page.\nA list of all the priority locations with a description of the solution at each location is available in the 125 eligible priority locations document.\nThe nominated locations were announced by the Government as part of the Federal Election in 2016. The locations nominated have been identified as areas with poor or no mobile coverage, which had not at that time had their coverage issues resolved under the program.\nThe rollout sequence for each round of the Mobile Black Spot Program is determined by the mobile network operators based on various factors, including obtaining local government planning approval, landowner agreement where necessary, and access to existing infrastructure, power and backhaul.\nThe rollout schedules are regularly updated on the carriers' websites as the rollout progresses.\nRound 4\nOn 18 March 2019, the Minister for Regional Services, Senator the Hon Bridget McKenzie, announced the outcomes of the Round 4 competitive assessment process. Round 4 of the Program will deliver 180 new mobile base stations (49 Optus and 131 Telstra) to address more coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 4 of the Program targets regional and remote black spot locations, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers are invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 4 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 4.\nRound 4 base stations are currently being rolled out across the country, due to be complete by Q2 2020. However, base station constructions can be subject to delays for a variety of reasons outlined below. Refer to the mobile carriers' websites for more details and updates on the rollout.\n73 base stations will specifically target coverage issues at Public Interest Premises, such as tourist sites and emergency services facilities.\nA Public Interest Premises is defined as a premises or location that the Program considers is used on a continuing basis for a public interest purpose, and which may include:\n- an economic centre\n- an emergency services facility\n- a health facility\n- an educational facility\n- an indigenous community organisation\n- a local government facility\n- a not-for-profit organisation.\nRound 5\nIn April 2020, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, The Hon Paul Fletcher MP, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government, The Hon Mark Coulton MP, announced the results of the Round 5 competitive assessment process.\nRound 5 will deliver 182 new mobile base stations (two from Field Solutions Group, 83 from Optus and 97 from Telstra) to continue to address coverage issues in regional and remote Australia.\nRound 5 of the Program targeted regional and remote areas, including Public Interest Premises, across Australia. Mobile Network Operators and Infrastructure Providers were invited to submit proposals to improve mobile coverage at black spot locations in regional and remote Australia.\nAll applications were competitively assessed on a solution by solution basis. The Round 5 Guidelines published on GrantConnect provide more information on how locations were selected for funding under Round 5.\nThe rollout is expected to commence shortly, with the first new base stations being activated by the second half of the year.\nIn April 2020 the Government released a discussion paper seeking feedback from industry and community on options for the design of a Round 5A of the Program.\nFunding for Round 5A will be drawn from the unused portion of the funding allocated to Round 5 to expand and improve mobile coverage for regional and remote Australia.\nFurther information can be found on the Round 5A 'Have your say' page, Consultation on design options for Round 5A of the Mobile Black Spot Program.\nRound 6\nThe Government has committed $80 million in funding to a Round 6 of the Program, which will commence following Round 5A.\nGeneral\nThe National Mobile Black Spot Database closed for nominations on 11 October 2018, although locations not on the database can still be funded. New nominations are not being accepted at this time.\nThe Government has committed $380 million to the Mobile Black Spot Program to invest in telecommunications infrastructure to extend and improve mobile phone coverage and competition across six rounds of the program.\nAdditionally, we are encouraging the mobile network operators to continue their investment in their regional mobile networks.\nBase stations that have been delayed\nBase station deployment is a complex process that typically takes between 12 and 18 months to complete. A number of separate phases are involved including site inspection, detailed design, planning approvals, site acquisition, construction and final activation.\nAs well as the mobile network operator building the base station, a number of external parties are directly and indirectly involved in the deployment process. These other parties include land owners, local communities, local councils, state government departments, power authorities, other mobile network operators, equipment manufacturers and infrastructure providers.\nPlanning approvals and site acquisition in particular are subject to external processes that are typically outside of the direct control of the mobile network operators.\nIn some instances, these external factors may impact the delivery timeframe for a base station. For example, additional fauna or flora surveys may be required before local planning approval is granted, or negotiations with land owners may take longer than anticipated.\nThe mobile network operators are committed to working through issues as they arise. The program remains focused in delivering new coverage as soon as possible.\nInformation about the expected timing for individual base stations can be found on the mobile network operators' and infrastructure providers' websites: Field Solutions Group, Optus, Telstra and Vodafone. The mobile network operators and infrastructure providers regularly update their rollout schedules as the rollout progresses.\nBase stations that are no longer required or cannot be built\nIn a small number of cases a base station is no longer required as the coverage that the base station would have provided is now being delivered by one or more other funded base stations nearby.\nReasons why a base station cannot be built vary, but can include difficulty in obtaining planning approval for a base station at the original scheduled location, difficulty reaching agreement with the land owner/s to use the site, as well as unforeseen technical issues with integrating the base station into the existing mobile network.\nBefore declaring that a base station cannot be built at its scheduled location, the mobile network operator will explore all options to provide new and improved coverage to the location, including investigating alternative sites.\nIn some cases the carrier has been able to enhance another base station in the area to meet the coverage requirements of the originally planned base station.\nIf the mobile network operator has exhausted all options and a planned base station cannot be built at its original scheduled location, then funding for the original base station can be used to fund an alternative site.\nIn this situation, the mobile network operator is required to propose a new site that will offer new handheld mobile coverage to another nominated mobile black spot location that is included on the Government's database of reported mobile black spots.\nState government approval of the proposed alternative site is required if the original scheduled site is co-funded by the state.\nThe following base stations have been approved as alternative sites and will now be funded under the program:\n- Beachmere North, QLD\n- Boggabri, NSW\n- Boondooma, QLD\n- Bryant Road, (Marchagee East), WA\n- Burringurrah, WA\n- Cape Hillsborough, QLD\n- Carcoar, NSW\n- Charleroi, VIC\n- Denbarker, WA\n- Duke of Orleans (Caravan Park), WA\n- Girard Hilltop, NSW\n- Goldie, VIC\n- Gollan, NSW\n- Graytown, VIC\n- Guluguba, QLD\n- Honeymoon Bay, WA\n- Jiggi, NSW\n- Jurien East, WA\n- Kalannie North, WA\n- Kanmantoo, SA\n- Keswick Island, QLD\n- Kingsford, WA\n- Lake Magenta, WA\n- Lingara, NT\n- Muirs Highway, Dingup, WA\n- Mulan, WA\n- North Dorrigo, NSW\n- Orpheus Island, QLD\n- Parnngurr, WA\n- Rainbow Valley, NT\n- Ravensthorpe North, WA\n- Tabulam, NSW\n- Tintaldra, VIC\n- Traralgon South, VIC\n- William Bay, WA\n- Wilroy, WA\n- Wyndham, NSW.\nThe following base stations are no longer required to be built under the Program as one or more funded base stations nearby are now able to provide coverage to the scheduled black spot area:\n- Bonalbo B, NSW\n- Lower Peacock, NSW\n- Ocean Beach, WA\nThe following base stations cannot be built under the program due to unforeseen technical or site acquisition issues.

Training in linguistics can help teachers more effectively communicate with their students, to understand how language operates within the classroom and in the wider community. A teacher trained as a linguist is skilled at recognizing how language used in the classroom reflects and constructs social identities (such as gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, race, region, and class), or how knowledge of pragmatics (how language functions in context) can help teachers to identify critical elements of language which play a role in communicating meaning. Such knowledge can inform both the process and products of education, including how teachers design lectures and structure classroom interactions.\n- Business: An awareness of language and communication has a broad range of applications in the business world. Generally speaking, one of the most valuable skills that a linguist possesses is that of knowing how to use language accurately and persuasively. Linguists are trained to observe how language is used and interpreted in different contexts, which has been applied very productively in such fields as marketing, branding, and advertising.\n- Government: Many governmental organizations actively recruit linguists, particularly for translation, interpretation, and cultural analyses.
